<h2><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>It seems but a week or two ago that Frederic Kitton first mentioned
to me the preparation of the volume to which I have now
the melancholy privilege of prefixing a few words of introduction
and valediction. It was in my office in Covent Garden, where
he used often to drop in of an afternoon and talk, for a spare
half-hour at the end of the day, of Dickens and Dickensian interests.
We were speaking of a book which had just been published, somewhat
similar in scope to the volume now in the reader&rsquo;s hand, and
Kitton, with that thoroughly genial sympathy which always marked
his references to other men&rsquo;s work, praised warmly and heartily the
good qualities which he had found in its composition. Then, quite
quietly, and as though he were alluding to some entirely unimportant
side-issue, he added: &ldquo;I have a book rather on the same lines
on the stocks myself, but I don&rsquo;t know when it will get finished.&rdquo;
That was a little more than a year ago, and in the interval how
much has happened! The book has, indeed, &ldquo;got finished&rdquo; in the
pressure of that indefatigable industry which his friends knew so
well, but its author was never to see it in type. Almost before it
had received his finishing touches, the bright, kindly, humane
spirit of Frederic Kitton was &ldquo;at rest and forever.&rdquo; He died on
Saturday, September 10, 1904, and left the world appreciably poorer
by the loss of a sincere and zealous student, a true and generous
man.</p>
<p>As I turned over the pages of the book in proof, and recalled this
passing conversation, it seemed to me that the whole character of
its author was displayed, as under a sudden light, in that quite
unconscious attitude of his towards the two books&mdash;the one his
friend&rsquo;s, the other his own. For no one that I ever met was freer
from anything like literary jealousy or the spirit of rivalry in art;
no one was ever more modest concerning his own achievements.
And in this case, it must be remembered, he was speaking of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
particular piece of work for which no writer in England was so well
qualified as himself. His work had its limitations, and he knew
them well enough himself. For treatment of a subject on a broad
plane, critically, he had little taste; indeed, many of his friends
may remember that at times, when they may have indulged
too liberally in a wide literary generalization, he was inclined,
quietly and almost deprecatingly, to suggest some single contrary
instance which seemed to throw the generalization out of gear at
once. He saw life and literature like a mosaic; his eye was on
the pieces, not upon the piece; and this microscopic view had its
inevitable drawbacks and hindrances. On the other hand, when
it came to a subject like that of the present volume, his method was
not only a good one, but positively the best and only certain method
possible. His laborious care for detail, his unfailing accuracy&mdash;never
satisfied till he had traced the topic home under his own
eye&mdash;his loving accumulation of little facts that contribute to the
general impression&mdash;all these conspicuous traits made him the one
man qualified to speak upon such a subject with confidence and
authority. One sometimes felt that he knew everything there was
to know about Dickens and the circle in which Dickens lived.
The minuteness of his knowledge could only be appreciated by
those who had occasion to test it in actual conversation, in that
give-and-take of question and answer by which showy, shallow
information and pretentious ignorance are so quickly discomfited
and exposed. He had not only, for example, traced almost every
published line and letter of Dickens himself, but he could tell you,
in turning over old numbers of <i>Household Words</i>, the author of
every single inconsiderable contribution to that journal; he was
familiar with the manner and the production of all the <i>infusoria</i> of
Wellington Street. It was a wonderful wealth of information, and
his habit of acquiring and fostering it was born and bred in his
very nature. In this, as in many other respects, he was essentially
his father&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>When I ventured, a page further back, to call his method
&ldquo;microscopic,&rdquo; the word slipped naturally from my pen, but in a
moment its indisputable propriety asserted itself. Frederic George
Kitton was trained in the school of microscopy. He was born at
Norwich on May 5, 1856, and his father, who had then only just
completed his twenty-ninth year, was already known among his
associates as a scientist of much research and no little originality
of observation. Frederic Kitton the elder was the son of a Cambridge
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
ironmonger, and had been intended for the legal profession;
but his father&rsquo;s business did not prosper, and the whole family was
obliged to remove to Norwich, there to take up work in a wholesale
tobacco business, the proprietor of which was one Robert Wigham,
a botanist of some repute. This Mr. Wigham soon saw that Kitton
was a clever lad, and, finding him interested in the studies which
were his own diversion, trained him in botany and other scientific
branches of research. The young man soon surpassed his tutor
in knowledge and resource, and by the time that he was married
and the father of our own friend, Frederic George Kitton, he had
made a name among the leading diatomists of his time, and was
reputed to be more successful in finding rare specimens than any
other man in the country. His reputation and his industry increased
together, with the result that the son grew up in an atmosphere of
unsparing research and conscientious accuracy of observation which
never failed him as an example for life. We may fairly attribute the
general outlines of F. G. Kitton&rsquo;s method to the inspiration he
received at his father&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>This inspiration found its first expression upon the lines of art.
The boy showed great ability with his pencil, and was apprenticed
to wood engraving, joining the staff of the <i>Graphic</i>, and contributing
any number of pencil drawings and woodcuts to its columns, in the
days before the cheap processes of reproduction had supplanted
these genuine forms of art-workmanship. His landscapes and his
pictures of old buildings and romantic architecture were full of
breadth and feeling, and some of the best of them were devoted
to an early book of travel in the Dickens country, in which he
collaborated with the late William R. Hughes. Indeed, much of
the most picturesque work of his life was done in the way of black
and white.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-six, however, he decided to be less of an
artist and more of a writer, and retired finally from the ranks of
illustrated journalism. He settled about this time at St. Albans
in Hertfordshire, and began his long series of books, most of them
dedicated to his lifelong study of Dickens and his contemporaries.
His first books of the kind treated, not unnaturally, of the various
illustrators of Dickens&rsquo;s novels, and monographs on Hablot K.
Browne and John Leech attracted attention for their fidelity and
sympathetic taste. Following these came &ldquo;Dickensiana: a Bibliography
of the Literature relating to Charles Dickens and His
Writings&rdquo; (1886); &ldquo;Charles Dickens by Pen and Pencil&rdquo; (1890);
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
&ldquo;Artistic London: from the Abbey to the Tower with Dickens&rdquo;
(1891); &ldquo;The Novels of Charles Dickens: a Bibliography and a
Sketch&rdquo; (1897); &ldquo;Dickens and His Illustrators&rdquo; (1899); &ldquo;The
Minor Writings of Charles Dickens&rdquo; (1900); &ldquo;Charles Dickens:
His Life, Writings, and Personality&rdquo; (1902); and innumerable
editorial works, among which must be mentioned his notes to the
Rochester Edition of Dickens, his recension of Dickens&rsquo;s verse,
and his general conduct of the Autograph Edition now in course
of publication in America&mdash;a laborious undertaking, which included
a series of bibliographical notes from his pen of the very first value
to all students of &ldquo;Dickensiana.&rdquo; He had also in MS. a valuable
dictionary of Dickens topography, illustrated by descriptive quotations
from the novels themselves; and, finally, he left the &ldquo;copy&rdquo;
for the present book, which will rank among the most useful and
characteristic of all his contributions to the study of the author
whom he so much admired and so sincerely served.</p>
<p>Kitton was only forty-eight when he died, and the work which
he had done was large in bulk and rich in testimony to his industry;
but he was far from accomplishing the volume of work which he
had already set before himself. It is no secret that the short
&ldquo;Life of Dickens&rdquo; which he published two and a half years ago
was only regarded by himself as the framework upon which he
proposed to construct a much more elaborate biography, to be at
least as long as Forster&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; fortified by a vast array of facts
which Forster had not been disposed, or careful enough, to collect.
The book would have been full of material and value; but there
were some of us who believed that Kitton&rsquo;s talent might be even
better employed in a work which none but himself could have satisfactorily
accomplished&mdash;the preparation of an elaborate annotated
edition of Forster, constructed upon the scale of Birkbeck Hill&rsquo;s
monumental Boswell, and illustrated by all the fruits of Kitton&rsquo;s
profitable research. We talked the matter over together, and he
was enthusiastically willing to essay the task. But obstacles arose
at the moment, and now the work can never be done as he would
have done it. His talent was peculiarly adapted to annotation;
his knowledge of the subject was unparalleled. If the work is ever
done (and I suppose it is bound to be done some day), it can never
be done now with that surety and deliberate finality which he
would have had at his disposal.</p>
<p>But one must not speak of Kitton only as a student of literature
and an artist; any picture of him that seemed to suggest that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
was rooted to his desk and his desk-work, to the exclusion of
outside interests and social activities, would give a very false impression
of his energetic and amiable temperament. There are
many books standing to Kitton&rsquo;s name in the catalogue of the
British Museum, and innumerable articles of his writing in the
files of the reviews, magazines, and newspapers of the last twenty
years, but his work extended far beyond the limits of print and
paper. He was not only an industrious man of letters, but a most
helpful and self-sacrificing citizen. His adopted town of St. Albans,
and the county of Hertfordshire at large, had no little cause for
gratitude in all he did in their interests. Despite the amount of
literary work he got through, there was scarcely a day that passed
without finding him at work at the Hertfordshire County Museum,
where he took sole charge of the prints and books, a collection which
his care and judgment made both exhaustive and invaluable. He
was continually at work, arranging and adding to the books and
prints, and outside the walls of the museum he did inestimable
service in preserving the ancient buildings of the town of St. Albans.
Had it not been for his intervention, many of the most interesting
old houses in the town would have been pulled down; he argued
with callous owners and vandal jerry-builders, and managed to
retain for the town those characteristic and historic buildings
around the abbey which in days to come will be the chief attraction
of the picturesque county town he loved to serve.</p>
<p>And so, with hard work at his desk and unsparing energy out of
doors, his bright, unselfish spirit wore itself out. He never looked
strong, but I do not think he seemed actually ill when one spring
morning in this last year he came in to see me at my office, and
told me, with his easy, unapprehensive smile, that he was about to
undergo an operation. &ldquo;It is only a small matter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
the doctors say I ought to have it done. I hope I shall soon be
back again, and we will have a further talk over that book you
know about.&rdquo; We parted, as men part at the cross-roads, feeling
sure of meeting on the morrow. But I never saw him again.
The operation he had made so light of proved too much for a constitution
already undermined by hard, unselfish work. He lingered
on, but never really rallied, and the end came very quietly, to
close a life that had always brought with it a sense of peace
and gentle will, wherever it had touched, whomsoever it had
influenced.</p>
<p>For, when other shifting recollections of Frederic Kitton fade
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
away&mdash;accidents of a common interest, chances of a brief and busy
acquaintanceship&mdash;the impression that remains, and will always
remain with those who knew him, is the haunting impression of a
sweet and winning simplicity, an absolute sincerity of life and
word, that knew no use for the thing he said but that it should be
the thing he thought, and that never (so it seemed) thought anything
of man, or woman, or child but what was kind and Christian
and noble-hearted. He looked you in the eyes in a fearless, open
fashion, as a man who had nothing to conceal and nothing to
pretend; he smiled with a peculiarly sunny and unhesitating
smile, as one who had tried life and found it good. And yet, as
the common rewards of life go, he had less cause to be thankful than
many who complain; he had to work hard (how hard it is not ours
to say) for the ordinary daily gifts of homely comfort. He had
little time to rest or play, and little means of recreation. Yet no
friend of his, I believe, however intimate, ever heard him grumble
about work and the badness of the times. He had a happy
home, bright and blithe with the carol of the cricket on the
hearth, and brighter and blither for his own affectionate nature;
and his happy spirit seemed to ask for nothing that lay outside the
four walls of his plain contentment. He knew the secret of life&mdash;a
simple secret, but hard to find, and harder to remember. He
had no touch of self in all his composition, no taint of self-interest
or self-care. He lived for others: and in their memory he will
survive so long as earthly recollections and earthly examples
return to encourage and to inspire.

<h1 title="">THE DICKENS COUNTRY</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PORTSMOUTH AND CHATHAM.</span></h2>
<p>The writer of an article in a well-known magazine
conceived the idea of preparing a map of England
that should indicate, by means of a tint, those portions
especially associated with Charles Dickens and his
writings. This map makes manifest the fact that
the country thus most intimately connected with the
novelist is the south-eastern portion of England,
having London as the centre and Rochester as the
&ldquo;literary capital,&rdquo; and including the counties of Norfolk,
Suffolk, Essex, Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire,
and Warwickshire, with an offshoot extending to the
northern boundary of Yorkshire.</p>
<p>All literary pilgrims, and particularly the devotees
of Charles Dickens, regard as foremost among literary
shrines inviting special homage the scene of the
nativity of &ldquo;Immortal Boz.&rdquo; Like the birthplaces
of many an eminent personage who first saw the
light in the midst of a humble environment, the
dwelling in which Dickens was born is unpretentious
enough, and remains unaltered. The modest abode
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
rented shortly after marriage by John Dickens (the
future novelist&rsquo;s father), from June, 1809, to June,
1812, stands in Commercial Road, Portsmouth, the
number of the house having been recently changed
from 387 to 393. The district was then known as
Landport, in the Island of Portsea, but is now incorporated
with Portsmouth; a comparatively rural
locality at that time, it has since developed into
a densely populated neighbourhood, covered with
houses and bisected by the main line of the municipal
tramways.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> It is, however, yet within the memory
of middle-aged people when this area of brick and
mortar consisted of pasture land in which trees
flourished and afforded nesting-places for innumerable
birds&mdash;a condition of things recalled by the names
bestowed upon some of the streets hereabouts, such
as Cherry Garden Lane and Elm Road&mdash;but now
&ldquo;only children flourish where once the daisies sprang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The birthplace of Charles Dickens, which less
than half a century ago overlooked green fields, is
an interesting survival of those days of arboreal
delights; and the broad road, on the west side of
which it is situated, leads to Cosham and the picturesque
ruin of Porchester Castle. In 1809 John
Dickens was transferred from Somerset House to
the Navy Pay-Office at Portsmouth Dockyard, and,
with his young wife, made his home here, in which
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
were born their first child (Frances Elizabeth) in
1810, and Charles on February 7, 1812. This
domicile is a plain, red-brick building containing
four rooms of moderate size and two attics, with
domestic offices; in front there is a small garden,
separated from the public roadway by an iron palisading;
and a few steps, with a hand-rail, lead from
the forecourt to the hooded doorway of the principal
entrance. The front bedroom is believed to be the
room in which Dickens was born. From the apartments
in the rear there is still a pleasant prospect,
overlooking a long garden, where flourishes an
eminently fine specimen of the tree-mallow. On
the death of Mrs. Sarah Pearce, the owner and
occupier (and last surviving daughter of John
Dickens&rsquo;s landlord), the house was offered for sale
by public auction on Michaelmas Day, 1903, when,
much to the delight of the townspeople as well as of
all lovers of the great novelist, it was purchased by
the Portsmouth Town Council for preservation as a
Dickens memorial, and with the intention of adapting
it for the purposes of a Dickens Museum. The
purchase price was &pound;1,125, a sum exceeding by five
hundred pounds the amount realized on the same
occasion by the adjoining freehold residence (No. 395),
which is identical in character&mdash;an interesting and
significant testimony as to the sentimental value
attaching to the birthplace of &ldquo;Boz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Dickens, like David Copperfield, was
ushered into the world &ldquo;on a Friday,&rdquo; and, when less
than a month old, underwent the ordeal of baptism
at the parish church of Portsea, locally and popularly
known as St. Mary&rsquo;s, Kingston, and dating from the
reign of Edward III. In 1882 a plan for its restoration
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
and enlargement was proposed, but a few years
later the authorities resolved to demolish it altogether
and build a larger parochial church from designs by
Sir Arthur Blomfield, A.R.A., the foundation stone
of which was laid by Queen Victoria early in the
spring of 1887, one half of the estimated cost being
defrayed by an anonymous donor. On its completion
the people of Portsmouth expressed a desire to
perpetuate the memory of Charles Dickens by inserting
in the new building a stained-glass window, but
were debarred by a clause in the novelist&rsquo;s will, where
he conjured his friends on no account to make him
&ldquo;the subject of any monument, memorial, or testimonial
whatever,&rdquo; as he rested his claim to the
remembrance of his country upon his published
works. It is not common knowledge that three
baptismal names were bestowed upon Dickens, viz.,
Charles John Huffam, the first being the Christian
name of his maternal grandfather, the second that of
his father, while the third was the surname of his
godfather, Christopher Huffam (incorrectly spelt
&ldquo;Huffham&rdquo; in the church register), who is described
in the London Postal Directory of that time as a
&ldquo;rigger in His Majesty&rsquo;s Navy&rdquo;; he lived at Limehouse
Hole, near the lower reaches of the Thames,
which afterwards played a conspicuous part in &ldquo;Our
Mutual Friend&rdquo; (&ldquo;Rogue Riderhood dwelt deep
and dark in Limehouse Hole, amongst the riggers,
and the mast, oar, and block-makers, and the boat-builders,
and the sail-lofts, as in a kind of ship&rsquo;s hold
stored full of waterside characters, some no better
than himself, some very much better, and none much
worse&rdquo;). It is interesting to know that the actual
font used at the ceremony of Charles Dickens&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
baptism has been preserved, and is now in St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Church, Portsea.</p>
<p>John Dickens, after a four years&rsquo; tenancy of No.
387, Mile End Terrace, went to reside in Hawke
Street, Portsea. Here he remained from Midsummer
Day, 1812, until Midsummer Day, 1814,
when he was recalled to London by the officials at
Somerset House.</p>
<p>I have spared no trouble in endeavouring to
discover the house in Hawke Street which John
Dickens and his family occupied. Mr. Robert
Langton, in his &ldquo;Childhood and Youth of Charles
Dickens&rdquo; (second edition), states that it is the
&ldquo;second house past the boundary of Portsea,&rdquo; which,
however, is not very helpful, as the following note
(kindly furnished by the Town Clerk of Portsmouth)
testifies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand what the connection can be
between Hawke Street and the borough boundary.
The town of Portsea, no doubt, had a recognised
boundary, because at one time the greater part of it
was encircled by ramparts, but Hawke Street did
not come near those ramparts. The old borough
boundary was outside the ramparts, both of Portsmouth
and Portsea, and therefore Hawke Street did
not touch that boundary. Since then the borough
boundary has been extended on more than one
occasion, and, of course, these boundaries could not
touch Hawke Street.&rdquo; A letter sent by me to the
Portsmouth newspapers having reference to this
subject brought me into communication with a
Southsea lady, who informs me that an old gentleman
of her acquaintance (an octogenarian) lived in
his youth at No. 8, Hawke Street, and he clearly
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
remembers that the Dickens family resided at No. 16.
Hawke Street, in those days, he says, was a most
respectable locality, the tenants being people of a
good class, while there were superior lodging-houses
for naval officers who desired to be within easy reach
of their ships in the royal dockyard, distant about
five minutes&rsquo; walk. No. 16, Hawke Street is a
house of three floors and a basement; three steps
lead to the front door, and there are two bay-windows,
one above the other. The tenant whom
John Dickens succeeded was Chatterton, harpist to
the late Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>Forster relates, as an illustration of Charles
Dickens&rsquo;s wonderfully retentive memory, that late
in life he could recall many minor incidents of his
childhood, even the house at Portsea (<i>i.e.</i>, his birthplace
in Commercial Road), and the nurse watching
him (then not more than two years old) from &ldquo;a
low kitchen window almost level with the gravel
walk&rdquo; as he trotted about the &ldquo;small front garden&rdquo;
with his sister Fanny.</p>
<p>Dickens&rsquo;s memory obviously failed him on this
point, for he was a mere infant of barely five months
old when his parents left Commercial Road to reside
in Hawke Street, a fact which he had probably forgotten,
and of which Forster had no knowledge, as
no mention is made by him of the latter street.
Here the family had lived two years when John
Dickens was recalled to London. I therefore venture
to suggest that the novelist vaguely recalled certain
incidents of his childhood associated with Hawke
Street. True, there is no &ldquo;small front garden&rdquo; at
No. 16 (indeed, all the houses here are flush with the
sidewalk), but at the back is a garden overlooked
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
by the kitchen window, which has an old-fashioned,
broad window-seat.</p>
<p>On quitting Portsea for the Metropolis, John
Dickens and his family occupied lodgings in Norfolk
Street (now Cleveland Street), on the east side of the
Middlesex Hospital. In a short time, however, he
was again &ldquo;detached,&rdquo; having received instructions
to join the staff at the Navy Pay-Office at Chatham
Dockyard. The date of departure is given by
Forster as 1816, and in all probability the Dickens
family again took lodgings until a suitable home
could be found. After careful research, the late Mr.
Robert Langton discovered that from June, 1817
(probably midsummer), until Lady Day, 1821, their
abode was at No. 2 (since altered to No. 11),
Ordnance Terrace. There little Charles passed some
of the happiest years of his childhood, and received
the most durable of his early impressions.</p>
<p>Chatham, on the river Medway, derives its name
from the Saxon word <i>Ceteham</i> or <i>C&aelig;ttham</i>, meaning
&ldquo;village of cottages.&rdquo; It is anything but a &ldquo;village&rdquo;
now, having since that remote age developed into a
river port and a populous fortified town. Remains
of Roman villas have been found in the neighbourhood,
thus testifying to its antiquity. Chatham is
one of the principal royal shipbuilding establishments
in the kingdom. The dockyard was founded by
Elizabeth before the threatened invasion of the
Spanish Armada, and removed to its present site in
1662; it is now nearly two miles in length, and
controlled by an Admiral-Superintendent, with a
staff of artisans and labourers numbering about
five thousand. Dickens describes and mentions
Chatham in several of his writings, and in one
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
of the earliest he refers to it by the name of
&ldquo;Mudfog.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Seven Poor Travellers&rdquo; he says of
Chatham: &ldquo;I call it this town because if anybody
present knows to a nicety where Rochester ends and
Chatham begins, it is more than I do.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s impressions of Chatham and the
neighbouring towns of Rochester, Strood, and
Brompton were that the principal productions
&ldquo;appear to be soldiers, sailors, Jews, chalk, shrimps,
officers, and dockyard men,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the commodities
chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets
are marine stores, hard-bake, apples, flat-fish, and
oysters.&rdquo; He observed that the streets presented
&ldquo;a lively and animated appearance, occasioned chiefly
by the conviviality of the military.&rdquo; &ldquo;The consumption
of tobacco in these towns,&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick
opined, &ldquo;must be very great, and the smell which
pervades the streets must be exceedingly delicious to
those who are extremely fond of smoking. A superficial
traveller might object to the dirt, which is their
leading characteristic, but to those who view it as an
indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is
truly gratifying.&rdquo; Were Mr. Pickwick to revisit
Chatham, he would find many of these characteristics
still prevailing, and could not fail to note, also, that
during the interval of more than sixty years the town
had undergone material changes in the direction of
modern improvements. When poor little David
Copperfield fled from his distressing experiences at
Murdstone and Grinby&rsquo;s, hoping to meet with a
welcome from Betsy Trotwood at Dover, he wended
his weary way through Rochester; and as he toiled into
Chatham, it seemed to him in the night&rsquo;s aspect &ldquo;a
mere dream of chalk, and drawbridges, and mastless
ships in a muddy river, roofed like Noah&rsquo;s arks.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">NORFOLK (NOW CLEVELAND) STREET, FITZROY SQUARE.</span> (<i><a href="#Page_7">Page 7</a>.</i>)
<br />Dickens and his parents resided in Norfolk Street in 1816, after their removal from Hawke Street, Portsea.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Dickens himself, when a boy, must have seen the
place frequently under similar conditions. The impressions
he then received of Chatham and the neighbourhood
were permanently fixed upon the mental
retina, to be recalled again and again when penning
his stories and descriptive pieces. In an article
written by him in collaboration with Richard Hengist
Horne, he supplies a picture of Chatham as it subsequently
appeared when the military element on the
main thoroughfares seemed paramount: &ldquo;Men were
only noticeable by scores, by hundreds, by thousands,
rank and file, companies, regiments, detachments,
vessels full for exportation. They walked about the
streets in rows or bodies, carrying their heads in
exactly the same way, and doing exactly the same
thing with their limbs. Nothing in the shape of
clothing was made for an individual, everything was
contracted for by the millions. The children of
Israel were established in Chatham, as salesmen, outfitters,
tailors, old clothesmen, army and navy accoutrement
makers, bill discounters, and general despoilers
of the Christian world, in tribes rather than in
families.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>John Dickens&rsquo;s official connection with the Navy
Pay Department offered facilities for little Charles to
roam unchecked about the busy dockyard, where he
experienced delight in watching the ropemakers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
anchor-smiths, and others at their labours, and in
gazing with curious awe at the convict hulks (or
prison ships), and where he found constant delight
in observing the innumerable changes and variety of
scenes; on one day witnessing the bright display of
military tactics on Chatham &ldquo;Lines,&rdquo; on another
enjoying a sail on the Medway with his father, when
on duty bound for Sheerness in the Commissioners&rsquo;
yacht, a quaint, high-sterned sailing-vessel, pierced
with circular ports, and dating from the seventeenth
century; she was broken up at Chatham in 1868.</p>
<p>The boy unconsciously stored up the pictures of
life, and character, and scenery thus brought to his
notice, to be recalled and utilized as valuable
material by-and-bye. Of the great dockyard he
afterwards wrote: &ldquo;It resounded with the noise of
hammers beating upon iron, and the great sheds or
slips under which the mighty men-of-war are built
loomed business-like when contemplated from the
opposite side of the river.... Great chimneys
smoking with a quiet&mdash;almost a lazy&mdash;air, like giants
smoking tobacco; and the giant shears moored off
it, looking meekly and inoffensively out of proportion,
like the giraffe of the machinery creation.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The famous Chatham Lines (constituting the fortifications
of the town), are immortalized in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;
as the scene of the review at which Mr.
Pickwick and his friends were present and got into
difficulties; and the field adjacent to Fort Pitt (now
the Chatham Military Hospital, standing on high
ground near the railway station), was the locality
selected for the intended duel between the irate
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Dr. Slammer and the craven (but innocent) Mr.
Winkle, both field and the contiguous land surrounding
Fort Pitt being now a public recreation
ground, whence is obtainable a fine panoramic view
of Chatham and Rochester. The &ldquo;Lines&rdquo; are today
locally understood as referring to an open space
near Fort Pitt, which is used as an exercising ground
for the soldiers at the barracks near by. All this
portion of the country possessed great attractions for
Dickens in later years; it was rendered familiar to
him when, as a lad, he accompanied his father in
walks about the locality, thus hallowed by old associations.</p>
<p>Ordnance Terrace, Chatham, retains much the
same aspect it possessed at the time of John Dickens&rsquo;s
residence there (1817-1821)&mdash;a row of three-storied
houses, prominently situated on high ground within
a short distance of the Chatham railway station.
The Dickens abode was the second house in the
terrace (now No. 11), whose front is now overgrown
with a Virginia creeper, and so redeems its bareness.
In describing the place, the late Mr. W. R. Hughes
says: &ldquo;It has the dining-room on the left-hand side
of the entrance and the drawing-room on the first
floor, and is altogether a pleasantly-situated, comfortable
and respectable dwelling.&rdquo; At Ordnance Terrace,
we are assured by Forster, it was that little
Charles (&ldquo;a very queer, small boy,&rdquo; as he afterwards
described himself at this period) lived with his parents
from his fifth to his ninth year; the child&rsquo;s &ldquo;first
desire for knowledge, and his greatest passion for
reading, were awakened by his mother, who taught
him the first rudiments, not only of English, but
also, a little later, of Latin.&rdquo; The same authority
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
states that he and his sister Fanny presently supplemented
these home studies by attending a preparatory
day-school in Rome Lane (now Railway Street),
and that when revisiting Chatham in his manhood
he tried to discover the place, found it had been
pulled down &ldquo;ages&rdquo; before to make room for a new
street; but there arose, nevertheless, &ldquo;a not dim
impression that it had been over a dyer&rsquo;s shop, that
he went up steps to it, that he had frequently grazed
his knees in doing so, and that, in trying to scrape
the mud off a very unsteady little shoe, he generally
got his leg over the scraper.&rdquo; Other recollections of
the Ordnance Terrace days flashed upon him when
engaged upon his &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; sketches; for example, the
old lady in the sketch entitled &ldquo;Our Parish&rdquo; was
drawn from a Mrs. Newnham who lived at No. 5 in
the Terrace, and the original of the Half-Pay Captain
(in the same sketch) was another near neighbour:
at No. 1 there resided a winsome, golden-haired
maiden named Lucy Stroughill, whom he regarded
as his little sweetheart, and who figures as &ldquo;Golden
Lucy&rdquo; in one of his Christmas stories,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> while her
brother George, &ldquo;a frank, open, and somewhat
daring boy,&rdquo; is believed to have inspired the creation
of James Steerforth in &ldquo;David Copperfield.&rdquo;</p>

<br />Occupied by John Dickens and his family, 1817-1821.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Little Charles must have been acquainted, too, with
the prototype of Joe, the Fat Boy in &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo;
whose real name was James Budden, and whose
father kept the Red Lion Inn at the corner of High
Street and Military Road, Chatham, where the lad&rsquo;s
remarkable obesity attracted general attention. The
Mitre Inn and Clarence Hotel at Chatham, described
in 1838 as &ldquo;the first posting-house in the town,&rdquo;
is also associated with Dickens&rsquo;s early years, and
remains very much as it was when he knew it as a
boy. At the period referred to the landlord of this
fine old hostelry was a Mr. Tribe, with whose family
Mr. and Mrs. John Dickens and their children were
on visiting terms; indeed, it is recorded that, at the
evening parties held at the Mitre, Charles distinguished
himself by singing solos (usually old sea
songs), and sometimes duets with his sister, both
being mounted on a dining table for a stage. The
Mitre is historically interesting by reason of the fact
that Lord Nelson used to reside there when on duty
at Chatham, a room he occupied being known as
&ldquo;Nelson&rsquo;s Cabin.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>In the eighteenth chapter of &ldquo;The Mystery of
Edwin Drood&rdquo; we find the place disguised as &ldquo;The
Crozier&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the orthodox hotel&rdquo; at Cloisterham
(<i>i.e.</i>, Rochester)&mdash;and in &ldquo;The Holly-Tree Inn&rdquo; it
is thus directly immortalized: &ldquo;There was an inn in
the cathedral town where I went to school, which
had pleasanter recollections about it than any of
these.... It was the inn where friends used to
put up, and where we used to go and see parents,
and to have salmon and fowls, and be tipped. It
had an ecclesiastical sign&mdash;the Mitre&mdash;and a bar that
seemed to be the next best thing to a bishopric, it
was so snug.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>John Dickens had by nature a very generous
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
disposition, which inclined him to be too lavish in
his expenditure. This idiosyncrasy, coupled with
the ever-increasing demands of a young and
growing family, compelled him to realize the immediate
necessity for retrenchment. Hitherto his
income (ranging from &pound;200 to &pound;350 per annum)
amply sufficed to provide for the comfort of wife
and children; but the time had arrived when rigid
economy became imperative, and early in 1821 he
removed into a less expensive and somewhat obscure
habitation at No. 18, St. Mary&rsquo;s Place (otherwise
called &ldquo;The Brook&rdquo;), Chatham, situated in the
valley through which a brook (now covered over)
flows into the Medway. The house on &ldquo;The
Brook,&rdquo; with a &ldquo;plain-looking whitewashed plaster
front, and a small garden before and behind,&rdquo; still
exists; it is a semi-detached, six-roomed tenement,
of a much humbler type than that in Ordnance
Terrace, and stands next to what is now the Drill
Hall of the Salvation Army, but which, in John
Dickens&rsquo;s time, was a Baptist meeting-house called
Providence Chapel. While the Dickens dwelling-place
remains unaltered, the neighbourhood has since
greatly deteriorated. The locality was then more
rural and not so crowded as now, many of the
people living there being of a quite respectable class.
The minister then officiating at Providence Chapel
was William Giles, whose son William had been
educated at Oxford, and afterwards kept a school
in Clover Lane (now Clover Street, the playground
since covered by a railway station), Chatham, whence
he moved to larger premises close by, still to be seen
at the corner of Rhode Street and Best Street. Both
Charles and his elder sister Fanny attended here as
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
day scholars, and the boy, under Mr. Giles&rsquo;s able
tuition, made rapid progress with his studies.
Apropos of Mr. Giles, it should be mentioned that
when his intelligent pupil had attained manhood and
achieved fame as the author of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; his old
schoolmaster sent him, as a token of admiration,
a silver snuff-box, the lid bearing an inscription
addressed &ldquo;To the Inimitable Boz.&rdquo; For a considerable
time afterwards Dickens jocosely alluded
to himself, in letters to intimate friends, as &ldquo;the
Inimitable.&rdquo; By the way, where is that snuff-box
now?</p>
<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s Place is in close proximity to the old
parish church of St. Mary, where the Dickens
family worshipped during their residence in Chatham.
It dates from the early part of the twelfth century,
but having lately undergone a process of rebuilding,
the edifice no longer possesses that quaintness which
formerly characterized it, both externally and internally.
The present structure, standing on a site
which has been occupied by a church from Saxon
times, has been erected from the designs of the late
Sir Arthur Blomfield, already mentioned as the
architect of the new parochial church of St. Mary,
Kingston. Happily, there are preserved in St. Mary&rsquo;s,
Chatham, some interesting remains of the Norman
edifice (<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1120), notably a fine doorway and staircase,
and the columns of the central arch of the nave.
Instead of the diminutive bell-turret originally surmounting
the roof of the nave, a lofty detached
tower now constitutes the most striking feature of
the church, which was consecrated on October 28,
1903, in the presence of Lord Roberts. It has
been suggested that the description of Blunderstone
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Church in &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; recalls in some
respects the old parish church of Chatham, so familiar
to Dickens in his boyhood, although the picture was
partly drawn from Blundeston Church, Suffolk:
&ldquo;Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed
pew! with a window near it, out of which
our house can be seen, and <i>is</i> seen many times
during the morning&rsquo;s service by Peggotty, who likes
to make herself as sure as she can that it&rsquo;s not being
robbed, or is not in flames.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> Dame Peggotty was no
doubt to some extent depicted from Charles Dickens&rsquo;s
nurse of those days, Mary Weller, who afterwards
married Thomas Gibson, a shipwright in the dockyard,
and whose death took place in 1888.</p>
<p>In the registers at Chatham Church are recorded
the entries of the baptism of three children born
in the parish to John and Elizabeth Dickens, the
parents of the novelist; and Mary Allen, an aunt of
Charles, was married by license there on December 11,
1821, to Dr. Lamert, a regimental surgeon, who
afterwards figured in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; as Dr. Slammer.
In the church registers may be found several names
subsequently used by Dickens in his stories&mdash;names
of persons who lived in the district&mdash;Sowerby
(Sowerberry), Tapley, Wren, Jasper, Weller, etc.,
the Tapleys and the Wellers being well-known cognomens,
for there are vaults in the church belonging
to the former family, and a gravestone in the churchyard
erected to the latter. At the west end of the
church there are two inscriptions to the family of
Stroughill, who lived in Ordnance Terrace, and to
whom reference has already been made. The Vicar,
in his appeal for subscriptions in aid of the restoration
fund, expressed a hope that the people of
Chatham would contribute towards the cost of a
memorial in the church to Charles Dickens. Apropos,
I may mention that the Council of that flourishing
institution the Dickens Fellowship have, very
rightly, approached the Corporation of Chatham
with the suggestion that they should place commemorative
tablets on the two houses in Chatham
in which he spent some of the happiest years of his
boyhood, and the Corporation have consented.</p>

<br />The Dickens family resided in the house next to Providence Chapel, 1821-1823.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>From an upper window at the side of the house,
No. 18, St. Mary&rsquo;s Place, an old graveyard was plainly
visible, and frequently at night little Charles and his
sister would gaze upon the God&rsquo;s-acre and at the
heavens above from that point of vantage. Some
thirty years later he recalled the circumstances in
a poetical little story entitled &ldquo;A Child&rsquo;s Dream of a
Star,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> a touching reminiscence of these early days,
where he says: &ldquo;There was once a child, and he
strolled about a good deal, and thought of a number
of things. He had a sister, who was a child too,
and his constant companion. These two used to
wonder all day long. They wondered at the beauty
of the flowers; they wondered at the height and
blueness of the sky; they wondered at the depth of
the bright water; they wondered at the goodness
and the power of God who made the lovely world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to say to one another sometimes,
Supposing all the children upon earth were to die,
would the flowers and the water and the sky be
sorry? They believed they would be sorry. For,
said they, the buds are the children of the flowers,
and the little playful streams that gambol down the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
hillsides are the children of the water, and the
smallest bright specks playing at hide-and-seek in the
sky all night must surely be the children of the stars;
and they would all be grieved to see their playmates,
the children of men, no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one clear shining star that used to
come out in the sky before the rest, near the church
spire, above the graves. It was larger and more
beautiful, they thought, than all the others, and
every night they watched for it, standing hand in
hand at a window. Whoever saw it first cried out,
&lsquo;I see the star!&rsquo; and often they cried out both
together, knowing so well when it would rise, and
where. So they grew to be such friends with it that,
before lying down in their beds, they always looked
out once again to bid it good-night; and when they
were turning round to sleep they used to say, &lsquo;God
bless the star!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">FORT PITT, CHATHAM. (<i><a href="#Page_18">Page 18</a>.</i>)
<br />The playground of Dickens in his childhood, and the scene of the duel in &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The Chatham days were replete with innocent
delights for little Charles, whose young life overflowed
with the happiness resulting therefrom. He
and his schoolfellows often went to see the sham
fights and siege operations on the &ldquo;Lines,&rdquo; and he
enjoyed many a ramble with his sister and nurse
in the fields about Fort Pitt; and &ldquo;the sky was so
blue, the sun was so bright, the water was so sparkling,
the leaves were so green, the flowers were so
lovely, and they heard such singing birds and saw so
many butterflies, that everything was beautiful.&rdquo; In
&ldquo;The Child&rsquo;s Story,&rdquo; whence these extracts are
culled, we find the following undoubted allusions to
some of the juvenile pleasures in which the children
indulged while at Chatham: &ldquo;They had the merriest
games that ever were played.... They had
holidays, too, and &lsquo;twelfth-cakes,&rsquo; and parties where
they danced till midnight, and real theatres, where
they saw palaces of real gold and silver rise out
of the real earth, and saw all the wonders of the
world at once. As to friends, they had such dear
friends and so many of them that I want the time to
reckon them up.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> At home there were picture-books
and toys&mdash;&ldquo;the finest toys in the world and
the most astonishing picture-books&rdquo;&mdash;and, above all,
in the little room adjoining his bedchamber a small
library, consisting of the works of Fielding, Smollett,
Defoe, Goldsmith, the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tales
of the Genii,&rdquo; which the boy perused with avidity
over and over again. &ldquo;They kept alive my fancy,&rdquo;
he said, as David Copperfield, &ldquo;and my hope of
something beyond that place and time ... and did
me no harm, for whatever harm was in some of
them was not there for me; <i>I</i> knew nothing of it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>
In referring afterwards to the &ldquo;readings&rdquo; and &ldquo;imaginations&rdquo;
which he described as brought away
from Chatham, he again observes with David: &ldquo;The
picture always rises in my mind of a summer evening,
the boys at play in the churchyard, and I, sitting on
my bed, reading as if for life. Every barn in the
neighbourhood, every stone in the church, and every
foot of the churchyard, had some association of its
own in my mind connected with these books, and
stood for some locality made famous in them&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>&mdash;words
that were written down as fact some years
before they found their way into the story.</p>
<p>Happily for the boy, he remained in ignorance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the changes impending at home, and unconscious of
the fact that he was about to relinquish for ever the
delectations afforded by those daily visions of his
childhood; the ships on the Medway, the military
paradings and man&oelig;uvres, the woods and pastures,
the delightful walks with his father to Rochester and
Cobham&mdash;all were to vanish, as Forster says, &ldquo;like a
dream&rdquo;; for in 1822 John Dickens was recalled
to Somerset House, and in the winter of that year
he departed by coach for London, accompanied by
his wife and children, excepting Charles, who was left
behind for a few weeks longer in the care of the
worthy schoolmaster, William Giles. Presently the
day arrived when the lonesome lad followed his
parents to the Metropolis, leaving behind him, alas!
everything that gave his &ldquo;ailing little life its
picturesqueness or sunshine&rdquo;; for he was really a
very sickly boy, and for that reason unable to join
with zest in the more vigorous sports of his playfellows,
which explains his fondness for reading,
so unusual in lads of his age.</p>
<p>Little Charles was only ten years old when he
bade farewell to Chatham, and took his place as a
passenger in the stage-coach &ldquo;Commodore.&rdquo; &ldquo;There
was no other inside passenger,&rdquo; he afterwards observed,
&ldquo;and I consumed my sandwiches in solitude
and dreariness, and it rained hard all the way, and I
thought life sloppier than I expected to find it.&rdquo;
Like Philip Pirrip, he might with more justice have
thought that henceforth he &ldquo;was for London and
greatness.&rdquo; Undoubtedly he experienced the same
sensations as those of that youthful hero who, under
similar circumstances, realized that &ldquo;all beyond was
so unknown and great that in a moment with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
strong heave and sob I broke into tears.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> Reminiscences
of that memorable journey are recorded
in one of that charming series of papers contributed
by him to <i>All the Year Round</i> under the general
title of &ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller.&rdquo; Dickens
here calls his boyhood&rsquo;s home &ldquo;Dullborough&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;most
of us come from Dullborough who come
from a country town&rdquo;&mdash;informing us that as he left
the place &ldquo;in the days when there were no railways
in the land,&rdquo; he left it in a stage-coach, and further
takes us into his confidence by saying that he had
never forgotten, nor lost the smell of, the damp straw
in which he was packed, &ldquo;like game, and forwarded,
carriage paid, to the Cross Keys, Wood Street,
Cheapside, London.&rdquo; These words were written in
June, 1860, and a few months later, when penning
the twentieth chapter of &ldquo;Great Expectations,&rdquo; he
again recalled the episode: &ldquo;The journey from our
town to the Metropolis was a journey of about five
hours. It was a little past mid-day when the four-horse
stage-coach by which I was a passenger got
into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross
Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.... The
coach that had carried me away was melodiously
called &lsquo;Timpson&rsquo;s Blue-Eyed Maid,&rsquo; and belonged to
Timpson, at the coach-office up-street.... Timpson&rsquo;s
was a moderate-sized coach-office (in fact, a
little coach-office), with an oval transparency in the
window, which looked beautiful by night, representing
one of Timpson&rsquo;s coaches in the act of passing a
milestone on the London road with great velocity,
completely full inside and out, and all the passengers
dressed in the first style of fashion, and enjoying
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
themselves tremendously.&rdquo; He found, on a later
visit to Rochester and Chatham, that Timpson&rsquo;s had
disappeared, for &ldquo;Pickford had come and knocked
Timpson&rsquo;s down,&rdquo; and &ldquo;had knocked two or three
houses down on each side of Timpson&rsquo;s, and then
had knocked the whole into one great establishment....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
The late Mr. Robert Langton states
that Timpson was really Simpson (the coach proprietor
at Chatham), and that the &ldquo;Blue-Eyed Maid&rdquo;
was a veritable coach, to which reference is also made
in the third chapter of &ldquo;Little Dorrit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If, as Forster tells us, the &ldquo;Commodore,&rdquo; and not
the &ldquo;Blue-Eyed Maid,&rdquo; conveyed little Charles to
London, it was the identical vehicle by which Mr.
Pickwick and his companions travelled from the
Golden Cross at Charing Cross to Rochester, as
duly set forth in the opening chapter of &ldquo;The Pickwick
Papers&rdquo;; this coach was driven by old Cholmeley
(or Chumley), who is said to have been the
original of Tony Weller, and concerning whom some
amusing anecdotes are related in &ldquo;Nimrod&rsquo;s Northern
Tour.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">BOYHOOD AND YOUTH IN LONDON.</span></h2>
<p>It was in the early spring of 1823 that Charles
Dickens made acquaintance with London for the
second time, that vast Metropolis which henceforth
continued to exercise a fascination over him, and in
the study of which, as well as of its various types of
humanity, he found a perpetual charm. His early
impressions, however, were not of the brightest,
having (as he subsequently observed) exchanged
&ldquo;everything that had given his ailing little life its
picturesqueness or sunshine&rdquo; for the comparatively
sordid environment of a London suburb, and suffered
the deprivation of the companionship of his playfellows
at Chatham to become a solitary lad under
circumstances that could not fail to make sorrowful
the stoutest heart, not the least depressing being
his father&rsquo;s money involvement with consequent
poverty at home. John Dickens, whose financial
affairs demanded retrenchment, had rented what
Forster describes as &ldquo;a mean, small tenement&rdquo; at
No. 16 (now No. 141), Bayham Street, Camden Town,
to-day one of the poorest parts of London, but not
quite so wretched then as we are led to suppose by
the reference in Forster&rsquo;s biography. The cottages
in Bayham Street, built in 1812, were comparatively
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
new in 1823, and then stood in the midst of what
may be regarded as rural surroundings, there being
a meadow at the back of the principal row of houses,
in which haymaking was carried on in its season,
while a beautiful walk across the fields led to Copenhagen
House. Dickens averred that &ldquo;a washer-woman
lived next door&rdquo; to his father, and &ldquo;a Bow
Street officer lived over the way.&rdquo; We learn, too,
that at the top of the street were some almshouses,
and when revisiting the spot many years later
Dickens told his biographer that &ldquo;to go to this
spot and look from it over the dust-heaps and dock-leaves
and fields at the cupola of St. Paul&rsquo;s looming
through the smoke was a treat that served him for
hours of vague reflection afterwards.&rdquo; A writer
who vividly remembered Camden Town as it
appeared when John Dickens lived there has placed
upon record some interesting particulars concerning
it. He says: &ldquo;In the days I am referring to gas was
unknown. We had little twinkling oil-lamps. As
soon as it became dark, the watchman went his
rounds, starting from his box at the north end of
Bayham Street, against the tea-gardens of the
Mother Red Cap, then a humble roadside house,
kept by a widow and her two daughters, of the
name of Young. Then the road between Kentish
and Camden Towns was very lonely&mdash;hardly safe after
dark. These certainly were drawbacks, for depredations
used frequently to be committed in the back
premises of the houses.... The nearest church
was Old St. Pancras, then in the midst of fields.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> Exception has been taken to Forster&rsquo;s use of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
word &ldquo;squalid&rdquo; as applied to the Bayham Street of
1823, and with justification, for persons of some standing
made it their abode, and we learn that in certain of
the twenty or thirty newly-erected houses there lived
Engelhart and Francis Holl, the celebrated engravers,
the latter the father of Frank Holl, the Royal Academician;
Charles Rolls and Henry Selous, artists of
note; and Angelo Selous, the dramatic author.
Thus it would appear that Bayham Street, during
the early part of its history, was eminently respectable,
and we are compelled to presume that Dickens&rsquo;s
unfavourable presentment of the locality was the outcome
of his own painful environment, such as would
be forcibly impressed upon the mind of a sickly child
(as he then was) and one keenly susceptible to outward
influences. Undoubtedly, as Forster remarks,
&ldquo;he felt crushed and chilled by the change from the
life at Chatham, breezy and full of colour, to the
little back garret in Bayham Street,&rdquo; and, looking
upon the dingy brick tenement to-day, it is not
difficult to realize this fact; for, although the house
itself could not have been less attractive than his
previous home on &ldquo;the Brook&rdquo; at Chatham, the
surroundings did not offer advantages in the shape
of country walks and riverside scenery such as the
immediate neighbourhood of Chatham afforded.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">16 (NOW 141) BAYHAM STREET, CAMDEN TOWN. (<i><a href="#Page_24">Page 24</a>.</i>)
<br />Dickens and his parents lived here in 1823. The house was also the residence of Mr. Micawber, and the district is mentioned in &ldquo;Dombey and Son&rdquo; under the name of Staggs Gardens.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Bayham Street was named after Bayham Abbey in
Sussex, one of the seats of the Marquis Camden.
Eighty years ago this part of suburban London was
but a village, and Bayham Street had grass struggling
through the newly-paved road. Thus we are forced
to the conclusion that the misery and depression of
spirits, from which little Charles suffered while living
here, must be attributed to family adversity and his
own isolated condition rather than to the character of
his environment. At this time his father&rsquo;s pecuniary
resources became so circumscribed as to compel the
observance of the strictest domestic economy, and
prevented him from continuing his son&rsquo;s education.
&ldquo;As I thought,&rdquo; said Dickens on one occasion very
bitterly, &ldquo;in the little back-garret in Bayham Street,
of all I had lost in losing Chatham, what would
I have given&mdash;if I had had anything to give&mdash;to
have been sent back to any other school, to have
been taught something anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of improving, the elder Dickens&rsquo;s affairs
grew from bad to worse, and all ordinary efforts to
propitiate his creditors having been exhausted, Mrs.
Dickens laudably resolved to attempt a solution of
the difficulty by means of a school for young ladies.
Accordingly, a house was taken at No. 4, Gower
Street North, whither the family removed in 1823.
This and the adjoining houses had only just been
built. The rate-book shows that No. 4 was taken
in the name of Mrs. Dickens, at an annual rental
of &pound;50, and that it was in the occupation of the
Dickens family from Michaelmas, 1823, to Lady Day,
1824, they having apparently left Bayham Street at
Christmas of the former year. No. 4, Gower Street
North stood a little to the north of Gower Street
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Chapel, erected in 1820, and still existing on the
west side of the road; the house, known in recent
times as No. 147, Gower Street, was demolished
about 1895, and an extension of Messrs. Maple&rsquo;s
premises now occupies the site. When, in 1890,
I visited the place with my friend the late Mr.
W. R. Hughes (author of &ldquo;A Week&rsquo;s Tramp in
Dickens Land&rdquo;), we found it in the occupation of
a manufacturer of artificial human eyes, a sort of
Mr. Venus, with his &ldquo;human eyes warious,&rdquo; as depicted
in &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo;; while there was a dancing
academy next door, reminiscent of Mr. Turveydrop,
the professor of deportment in &ldquo;Bleak House.&rdquo;
The Dickens residence had six small rooms, with
kitchen in basement, each front room having two
windows&mdash;altogether a fairly comfortable abode, but
minus a garden. The result of Mrs. Dickens&rsquo;s enterprise
proved as disastrous as that of Mrs. Micawber&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Poor Mrs. Micawber! She said she had tried to
exert herself; and so, I have no doubt, she had.
The centre of the street door was perfectly covered
with a great brass plate, on which was engraved,
&lsquo;Mrs. Micawber&rsquo;s Boarding Establishment for Young
Ladies&rsquo;; but I never found that any young ladies
had ever been to school there; or that any young
lady ever came, or proposed to come; or that the
least preparation was ever made to receive any young
lady.&rdquo; The actual facts are thus recorded in fiction,
and the futility of Mrs. Dickens&rsquo;s excellent intention
to retrieve the family misfortunes seemed inevitable,
in spite of the energy displayed by the youthful
Charles in distributing &ldquo;at a great many doors a
great many circulars,&rdquo; calling attention to the superior
advantages of the new seminary. The blow proved
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
a crushing one, rendering the prospect more hopeless
than ever. Importunate creditors, who could no
longer be kept at bay, effected the arrest of John
Dickens, who was conveyed forthwith to a prison
for debtors in the Borough of Southwark; his last
words to his heart-broken son as he was carried off
being similar to those despondingly uttered by Mr.
Micawber under like circumstances, to the effect
that the sun was set upon him for ever.</p>
<p>Forster says that the particular prison where John
Dickens suffered incarceration was the Marshalsea,
and this statement appears correct, judging from the
fragment of the novelist&rsquo;s autobiography which refers
to the unfortunate incident: &ldquo;And he told me, I
remember, to take warning by the Marshalsea, and
to observe that if a man had twenty pounds a year,
and spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and
sixpence, he would be happy; but that a shilling
spent the other way would make him wretched.&rdquo;
Another of Mr. Micawber&rsquo;s wise sayings, be it
observed. That impecunious gentleman (it will be
remembered) suffered imprisonment at the King&rsquo;s
Bench, and it may be surmised that the novelist
purposely changed the locale that old memories
should not be revived. Of debtors&rsquo; prisons considerable
knowledge is displayed in his books, his
personal acquaintance with them dating, of course,
from those days when the brightness of his young
life was obscured by the &ldquo;falling cloud&rdquo; to which he
compares this distressing time. Realistic and accurate
pictures of the most noteworthy of these blots upon
our social system may be found in the forcible description
in the fortieth chapter of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; of the
Fleet Prison, of which the last vestiges were removed
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
in 1872, and the site of which is now covered by
the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, and by
Messrs. Cassell and Co.&rsquo;s printing works; the King&rsquo;s
Bench Prison (long since demolished) figures prominently
in &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo;; while many of
the principal scenes in &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; are laid in
the departed Marshalsea, which adjoined the burial-ground
of St. George&rsquo;s Church in the Borough.
The extreme rear of the Marshalsea Prison, described
by Dickens in the preface to &ldquo;Little Dorrit,&rdquo; was
transformed into a warehouse in 1887.</p>
<p>The second chapter of Forster&rsquo;s biography makes
dismal reading, relating, as it does, the bitter experiences
of Charles Dickens&rsquo;s boyhood&mdash;experiences,
however, which yielded abundant material for future
use in his stories. With the breadwinner in the
clutches of the law, the wife and children, left stranded
in the Gower Street house, had a terrible struggle for
existence; we are told that in order to obtain the
necessaries of life their bits of furniture and various
domestic utensils were pawned or otherwise disposed
of, until at length the place was practically emptied
of its contents, and the inmates were perforce compelled
to encamp in the two parlours, living there
night and day. At this juncture a relative, James
Lamert (who had lodged with the family in Bayham
Street), heard of their misfortunes, and, through his
connection with Warren&rsquo;s Blacking Manufactory
at 30, Hungerford Stairs, Strand, provided an
occupation there for little Charles by which he could
earn a few shillings a week&mdash;a miserable pittance,
but extremely welcome under the circumstances, as,
by exercising strict economy, it enabled him to support
himself, thus making one mouth less to provide
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
for at home. Hungerford Stairs (in after-life he used
to declare that he knew <i>Hunger</i>-ford well!) stood near
the present Charing Cross railway bridge (which
usurps the old Hungerford Suspension Bridge, transferred
to Clifton), and the site of Hungerford Market
is covered by the railway station. Dickens has recorded
that &ldquo;the blacking warehouse was the last
house on the left-hand side of the way, at old
Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down
old house, abutting, of course, on the river, and
literally overrun with rats. Its wainscotted rooms
and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey
rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of
their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at
all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up
vividly before me, as if I were there again.&rdquo; The
blacking factory, which disappeared when Hungerford
Market went, is faithfully portrayed in the
eleventh chapter of &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; thinly
disguised as Murdstone and Grinby&rsquo;s Warehouse,
&ldquo;down in Blackfriars.&rdquo; Dickens, like David, was
keenly sensible of the humiliation of what he could
not help regarding as a very menial occupation&mdash;the
tying-up and labelling innumerable pots of paste-blacking&mdash;which
he was now destined to follow, and
for the remainder of his life he never recalled this
episode without a pang.</p>
<p>He reminded Forster how fond he was of roaming
about the neighbourhood of the Strand and Covent
Garden during the dinner hour, intently observing
the various types of humanity with precocious
interest, and storing up impressions which were
destined to prove invaluable to him. One of his
favourite localities was the Adelphi, and he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
particularly attracted by a little waterside tavern
called the Fox-under-the-Hill; doubtless the
incident narrated in the just-mentioned chapter of
&ldquo;Copperfield&rdquo;&mdash;the autobiographical chapter&mdash;is
true of himself, when he causes little David to confess
to a fondness for wandering about that &ldquo;mysterious
place with those dark arches,&rdquo; and to wonder what
the coalheavers thought of him, a solitary lad, as
he sat upon a bench outside the little public-house,
watching them as they danced.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> The pudding-shops
and beef-houses in the neighbourhood of St. Martin&rsquo;s
Lane and Drury Lane were familiar enough to him
in those days; for, with such a modest sum to invest
for his mid-day meal, he naturally compared notes as
to the charges made by each for a slice of pudding or
cold spiced beef before deciding upon the establishment
which should have the privilege of his custom.
He sometimes favoured Johnson&rsquo;s in Clare Court,
which is identical with the place patronized by David
Copperfield&mdash;viz., the &ldquo;famous alamode beef-house
near Drury Lane,&rdquo; where he gave the waiter a halfpenny,
and wished he hadn&rsquo;t taken it. In the
recently demolished Clare Court there existed in
those days two of the best alamode beef-shops in
London, the Old Thirteen Cantons and the
New Thirteen Cantons, and we read in a curious
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
book called &ldquo;The Epicure&rsquo;s Almanack&rdquo; (1815), that
&ldquo;the beef and liquors at either house are equally
good, and the attention of all who pass is attracted
by the display of fine sallads in the windows, which
display is daily executed with great ingenuity, and
comprehends a variety of neat devices, in which the
fine slices of red beetroot are pleasingly conspicuous.&rdquo;
The New Thirteen Cantons was kept by the
veritable Johnson himself. We are further informed
that he owned a clever dog called Carlo, &ldquo;who once
enacted so capital a part on the boards of Old Drury,&rdquo;
and whose sagacity &ldquo;brought as many customers
to Mr. Johnson as did the excellence of his fare.&rdquo;
Dickens, however, did not become acquainted with
Carlo, who, a few years before the lad knew the shop,
paid the penalty of a report that the famous animal
had been bitten by a mad dog. &ldquo;There were two
pudding-shops,&rdquo; said Dickens to his biographer,
&ldquo;between which I was divided, according to my
finances.&rdquo; One was in a court close to St. Martin&rsquo;s
Church, where the pudding was made with currants,
&ldquo;and was rather a special pudding,&rdquo; but dear; the
other was in the Strand, &ldquo;somewhere in that part
which has been rebuilt since,&rdquo; where the pudding was
much cheaper, being stout and pale, heavy and
flabby, with a few big raisins stuck in at great
distances apart. The more expensive shop stood in
Church Court (at the back of the church), demolished
when Adelaide Street was constructed about 1830,
and may probably be identified with the Oxford
eating-house, then existing opposite the departed
Hungerford Street; the other establishment, where
Dickens often dined for economy&rsquo;s sake, flourished
near the spot covered until quite recently by that
children&rsquo;s paradise, the Lowther Arcade. The courts
surrounding St. Martin&rsquo;s Church were formerly so
thronged with eating-houses that the district became
popularly known as &ldquo;Porridge Island.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Failing, by means of a certain &ldquo;deed,&rdquo; to propitiate
his creditors, John Dickens continued to remain
within the gloomy walls of the Marshalsea. The
home in Gower Street was thereupon broken up, and
Mrs. Dickens, with her family, went to live with her
husband in the prison. Little Charles, however, was
handed over as a lodger to a Mrs. Roylance, a
reduced old lady who afterwards figured as Mrs.
Pipchin in &ldquo;Dombey and Son.&rdquo; Mrs. Roylance,
long known to the family, resided in Little College
Street, Camden Town; it became College Street
West in 1828, and the portion north of King Street
has been known since 1887 as College Place. The
abode in question was probably No. 37, for,
according to the rate-book of 1824 (the period with
which I am dealing), the house so numbered (rated
at &pound;18) was occupied by Elizabeth <i>Raylase</i><a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> until the
following year, and demolished about 1890, at which
time the street was rebuilt.</p>
<p>The boy still carried on his uncongenial duties at
the blacking warehouse with satisfaction to his
employers, in spite of the acute mental suffering
he underwent. Experiencing a sense of loneliness
in being cut off from his parents, brothers, and sisters,
he pleaded to his father to be allowed to lodge nearer
the prison, with the result that he left Mrs. Roylance,
to take up his abode in Lant Street, Borough, where,
in the house of an insolvent court agent, a back attic
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
had been found for him, having from the little
window &ldquo;a pleasant prospect of a timber-yard.&rdquo;
Of Lant Street, as it probably then appeared, we
have a capital description in the thirty-second chapter
of the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers,&rdquo; for here it was that Bob
Sawyer found a lodgment with the amiable (!) Mrs.
Raddle and her husband, in the identical house,
maybe, as that tenanted by the insolvent court agent.
&ldquo;There is a repose about Lant Street, in the
Borough, which sheds a gentle melancholy upon the
soul. There are always a good many houses to let
in the street; it is a by-street, too, and its dulness is
soothing. A house in Lant Street would not come
within the denomination of a first-rate residence in
the strict acceptation of the term, but it is a most desirable
spot, nevertheless. If a man wished to abstract
himself from the world, to remove himself from
within the reach of temptation, to place himself
beyond the possibility of any inducement to look
out of the window, he should by all means go to
Lant Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this happy retreat are colonized a few clear-starchers,
a sprinkling of journeymen bookbinders,
one or two prison agents for the insolvent court,
several small housekeepers who are employed in the
docks, a handful of mantua-makers, and a seasoning
of jobbing tailors. The majority of the inhabitants
either direct their energies to the letting of furnished
apartments, or devote themselves to the healthful
and invigorating pursuit of mangling. The chief
features in the still life of the street are green shutters,
lodging-bills, brass door-plates, and bell-handles, the
principal specimens of animated nature, the pot-boy,
the muffin youth, and the baked-potato man. The
population is migratory, usually disappearing on the
verge of quarter-day, and generally by night. His
Majesty&rsquo;s revenues are seldom collected in this happy
valley; the rents are dubious, and the water communication
is very frequently cut off.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Lant Street, as Bob Sawyer informed Mr. Pickwick,
is near Guy&rsquo;s Hospital, &ldquo;little distance after you&rsquo;ve
passed St. George&rsquo;s Church&mdash;turns out of the High
Street on the right-hand side of the way.&rdquo; It has
not altered materially in its outward aspect since the
time when little Charles Dickens slept there, on the
floor of the back attic, an abode which he then
thought was &ldquo;a paradise.&rdquo; We may suppose that
such accommodation, poor as it must have been,
yielded some consolation to the lonely child by
reason of the fact that he was within easy reach of
his parents, and also because his landlord&mdash;a fat,
good-natured old gentleman, who was lame&mdash;and
his quiet old wife were very kind to him; and it is
interesting to know that they and their grown-up
son are immortalized in &ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop&rdquo;
as the Garland family. Little Charles looked forward
to Saturday nights, when his release from toil at an
earlier hour than usual enabled him to indulge his
fancy for rambling and loitering a little in the busy
thoroughfares between Hungerford Stairs and the
Marshalsea. His usual way home was over Blackfriars
Bridge, and then to the left along Charlotte
Street, which (he is careful to tell us) &ldquo;has Rowland
Hill&rsquo;s chapel on one side, and the likeness of a golden
dog licking a golden pot over a shop door on the
other,&rdquo; a quaint sign still existing here. He was
sometimes tempted to expend a penny to enter a
show-van which generally stood at a corner of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
street &ldquo;to see the fat pig, the wild Indian, and the
little lady,&rdquo; and for long afterwards could recall the
peculiar smell of hat-making then (and now) carried
on there.</p>
<p>The autobiographical record discloses another
characteristic incident, which was afterwards embodied
in the eleventh chapter of &ldquo;Copperfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One evening little Charles had acted as messenger
for his father at the Marshalsea, and was returning
to the prison by way of Westminster Bridge, when
he went into a public-house in Parliament Street, at
the corner of Derby Street, and ordered a glass
of the <i>very best</i> ale (the &ldquo;Genuine Stunning&rdquo;),
&ldquo;with a good head to it.&rdquo; &ldquo;The landlord,&rdquo; observes
Dickens, &ldquo;looked at me, in return, over the bar
from head to foot, with a strange smile on his
face; and instead of drawing the beer, looked round
the screen and said something to his wife, who came
out from behind it, with her work in her hand,
and joined him in surveying me. Here we stand,
all three, before me now, in my study at Devonshire
Terrace&mdash;the landlord in his shirt-sleeves, leaning
against the bar window-frame, his wife looking
over the little half-door, and I, in some confusion,
looking up at them from outside the partition.
They asked me a good many questions, as what my
name was, how old I was, where I lived, how I was
employed, etc., etc. To all of which, that I might
commit nobody, I invented appropriate answers.
They served me with the ale, though I expect it was
not the strongest on the premises; and the landlord&rsquo;s
wife, opening the little half-door and bending down,
gave me a kiss that was half-admiring and half-compassionate,
but all womanly and good.&rdquo; I am
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
sure &ldquo;so juvenile a customer was evidently unusual
at the Red Lion&rdquo;; and he explains that &ldquo;the occasion
was a festive one,&rdquo; either his own birthday or somebody
else&rsquo;s, but I doubt whether this would prove
sufficient justification in the eyes of the rigid total
abstainer. In &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; we find an
illustration of the scene depicted in a clever etching
by &ldquo;Phiz.&rdquo; The public-house here referred to is
the Red Lion, which has been lately rebuilt, and
differs considerably from the unpretentious tavern
as Dickens knew it; unfortunately, the sign of the
rampant red lion has not been replaced, but in its
stead we see a bust of the novelist, standing within
a niche in the principal front of the new building.</p>
<p>By a happy stroke of good fortune, a rather considerable
legacy from a relative accrued to John
Dickens, and had been paid into court during his
incarceration. This, in addition to the official
pension due for long service at Somerset House,
enabled him to meet his financial responsibilities,
with the result that the Marshalsea knew him no
more. Just then, too, the blacking business had
become larger, and was transferred to Chandos
Street, Covent Garden, where little Charles continued
to manipulate the pots, but in a more public manner;
for here the work was done in a window facing the
street, and generally in the presence of an admiring
crowd outside. The warehouse (pulled down in
1889) stood next to the shop at the corner of
Bedford Street in Chandos Street (the southern
corner, now the Civil Service Stores); opposite, there
was the public-house where the lad got his ale.
&ldquo;The stones on the street,&rdquo; he afterwards observed
to Forster, &ldquo;may be smoothed by my small feet
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
going across to it at dinner-time, and back again.&rdquo;
The basement of the warehouse became transformed
in later years into a chemist&rsquo;s shop, and the sign of
the tavern over the way was the Black Prince, closed
in 1888, and demolished shortly afterwards to make
room for buildings devoted to the medical school of
the Charing Cross Hospital. His release from
prison compelled the elder Dickens to seek another
abode for himself and family, and he obtained
temporary quarters with the before-mentioned Mrs.
Roylance of Little College Street. Thence, according
to Forster, they went to Hampstead, where the
elder Dickens had taken a house, and from there, in
1825, he removed to a small tenement in Johnson
Street, Somers Town, a poverty-stricken neighbourhood
even in those days, and changed but little since.
Johnson Street was then the last street in Somers
Town, and adjoined the fields between it and Camden
Town. It runs east from the north end of Seymour
Street, and the house occupied by the Dickens family
(including Charles, who had, of course, left his Lant
Street &ldquo;paradise&rdquo;) was No. 13, at the east end of the
north side, if we may rely upon the evidence afforded
by the rate-book. At that time the house was
numbered 29, and rated at &pound;20, the numbering being
changed to 13 at Christmas, 1825. In July of that
year the name of the tenant is entered in the rate-book
as Caroline Dickens, and so remains until
January, 1829, after which the house is marked
&ldquo;Empty.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Brighter days were in store for the Dickens family,
and especially for little Charles, whose father could
now afford to send him to a good school in the
neighbourhood, much to the boy&rsquo;s delight. Owing
to a quarrel (of which he was the subject) between
John Dickens and James Lamert, the father declared
that his boy should leave the blacking warehouse and
go to school instead. Thus terminated, suddenly
and unexpectedly, that period of his life which
Charles Dickens ever regarded with a feeling of
repugnance. &ldquo;Until old Hungerford Market was
pulled down,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;until old Hungerford
Stairs were destroyed, and the very nature of the
ground changed, I never had the courage to go back
to the place where my servitude began.&rdquo; He never
saw it, and could not endure to go near it, and, in
order that a certain smell of the cement used for
putting on the blacking-corks should not revive
unpleasant associations, he would invariably, when
approaching Warren&rsquo;s later establishment in Chandos
Street, cross over to the opposite side of the way.</p>
<p>He was about twelve years of age when he and
the blacking-pots parted company for ever, and the
new and more promising prospect opened before
him&mdash;a future replete with possibilities, and yielding
opportunities of which he knew the value and made
the best use. The school to which he was sent as
a day-scholar was called the Wellington House
Academy, the proprietor being a Welshman named
William Jones, whose &ldquo;classical and commercial&rdquo;
seminary stood at the north-east corner of Granby
Street, Hampstead Road. The residential portion
still exists, although doomed to early demolition;
but the detached schoolroom and large playground
disappeared in 1835, on the formation of the London
and Birmingham Railway, as it was then called. In
a paper entitled &ldquo;Our School,&rdquo; contributed to
<i>Household Words</i> in 1851, Dickens gives a thinly-veiled
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
account of Jones&rsquo;s Academy, and those of his
pupils who yet survive readily understand the various
allusions, and vouch for the general accuracy of the
presentment. &ldquo;It was a school,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of some
celebrity in its neighbourhood&mdash;nobody could say
why; the master was supposed among us to know
nothing, and one of the ushers was supposed to
know everything.&rdquo; There can be no doubt that
Wellington House Academy and its proprietor are
revived in &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; as Salem House
and Mr. Creakle.</p>
<p>The most accessible route for young Dickens to
follow between his home in Johnson Street and the
school was by way of Drummond Street, then a
quiet semi-rural thoroughfare, bounded on the north
side by the cow pastures belonging to an ancestor
of the late Cecil Rhodes (of South African fame),
many members of whose family were located here.
Dr. Dawson, a schoolfellow of Dickens at Wellington
House, well remembered him acting as ringleader of
other lads, and, simulating poverty, imploring charity
from people in Drummond Street, especially old ladies.</p>

<br />The home of Dickens in 1824.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Among other associations of the future novelist
with this locality may be mentioned his attendance
(in company with Dr. Dawson) at the Sunday
morning services in Somers Chapel (now called
St. Mary&rsquo;s Parish Church), in Seymour Street (then
partly fields), Somers Town,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> concerning which act
of piety Dr. Dawson regrets to observe that his
lively and irreverent young friend &ldquo;did not attend
in the slightest degree to the service, but incited me
to laughter by declaring his dinner was ready, and
the potatoes would be spoiled, and, in fact, behaved
in such a manner that it was lucky for us we
were not ejected from the chapel.&rdquo; He remained
at Wellington House Academy about two years
(1824-1826), without achieving any particular distinction
as a pupil. Thus ended his school training,
elementary at the best, and it has been truly observed
that a classical education might have &ldquo;done for&rdquo;
him&mdash;that &ldquo;Boz,&rdquo; like Burns, might have acquired
all necessary erudition in a Board school. &ldquo;Pray,
Mr. Dickens, where was your son educated?&rdquo; conjured
a friend of John Dickens, who significantly
and pertinently replied, &ldquo;Why, indeed, sir&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;he
may be said to have educated himself!&rdquo; a
response which the novelist used good-humouredly
and whimsically to imitate in Forster&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>On relinquishing his studies at the age of fourteen,
Charles Dickens for a brief period was installed as
clerk in the service of Mr. Molloy, a solicitor in New
Square, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. His father, however, presently
transferred him to the offices of Messrs. Ellis and
Blackmore, attorneys, at No. 1, Raymond Buildings,
Gray&rsquo;s Inn (second floor), the clerks&rsquo; office looking
out upon the roadway; here he performed similar
duties from May, 1827, to November, 1828, at
a weekly salary of 13s. 6d., rising to 15s. Although
he did not relish the law, and failed to appreciate
the particular kind of responsibility devolving upon
him as a humble apprentice to that profession, the
few months thus employed by him were productive
of fruitful results, for they afforded him opportunities
of studying the idiosyncrasies of lawyers, their clerks
and clients, which can only be obtained by intimate
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
association. In the words of David Copperfield, he
said: &ldquo;I looked at nothing that I know of, but I
saw everything,&rdquo; with the result that he culled from
his mental storehouse those vivid pictures of legal
life and character as portrayed in &ldquo;The Pickwick
Papers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sketches by Boz,&rdquo; and later works. The
Dickens family at this time had left the unattractive
environment of Johnson Street and made their home
at the Polygon, Somers Town, a much more respectable
and refined quarter, where Harold Skimpole (in
&ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo;) afterwards settled, and &ldquo;where
there were at that time a number of poor Spanish
refugees walking about in cloaks, smoking little paper
cigars.&rdquo; The Polygon was so called from the arrangement
of the houses in the form of a circle; it
stood within Clarendon Square, and, on completion,
became the aristocratic part of Somers Town; many
successful artists and engravers selecting it as a place
of residence.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
The name of Dickens, however, does
not appear in the contemporary rate-book, but we
find recorded there the significant fact that No. 17
was then &ldquo;let to lodgers&rdquo;&mdash;a very unusual entry&mdash;and
this, added to the fact that the rents were comparatively
high, justifies the assumption that the
Dickens family were lodgers only at the house bearing
that number. At this time John Dickens, with
commendable energy and perseverance, had acquired
the difficult art of shorthand writing, with a view to
obtaining a livelihood as a Parliamentary reporter.
He apparently changed his address with some frequency,
in 1832-1833 living for a time at Highgate,
whither Charles accompanied him, and lodging during
brief intervals in the western part of London. Certain
letters written by the son to an intimate friend
indicate such addresses as North End (? Fulham) and
Fitzroy Street.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The father, on securing an appointment as a
reporter for the <i>Morning Herald</i>, established himself
and his family (including Charles), at No. 18, Bentinck
Street, Manchester Square. The rate-book, however,
does not give his name as the tenant of this or any
other house in the street, so we must assume that the
family were again merely lodgers. This house and
its neighbours were recently demolished, being replaced
by a row of mansions, and, oddly enough,
the name of the occupier of No. 19 in 1895 bore
the novelist&rsquo;s patronymic.</p>
<p>On leaving Ellis and Blackmore&rsquo;s office in November,
1828, Charles Dickens abandoned the pursuit of
the law for ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The profession of journalism offering him superior
attractions, he was tempted to become a newspaper
reporter. With that object in view, he gave himself
up to the study of stenography, devoting much of
his time at the British Museum acquiring a knowledge
of the subject, and practising in the Law Courts
of Doctors&rsquo; Commons with extraordinary assiduity
until he arrived at something like proficiency. The
impediments that beset him are duly set forth in the
pages of &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; the incidents there
narrated being based upon the author&rsquo;s heart-breaking
experience in endeavouring to master the mysteries
of shorthand. Like David, he passed a period of
probation, lasting nearly two years, reporting for the
Proctors at Doctors&rsquo; Commons, St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard.
The scene of his labours is thus described in
&ldquo;Sketches by Boz&rdquo;: &ldquo;Crossing a quiet and shady
courtyard paved with stone, and frowned upon by
old red-brick houses, on the doors of which were
painted the names of sundry learned civilians, we
paused before a small, green-baized, brass-headed
nailed door, which, yielding to our gentle push, at
once admitted us into an old quaint-looking apartment,
with sunken windows and black carved wainscotting,
at the upper end of which, seated on a raised
platform of semicircular shape, were about a dozen
solemn-looking gentlemen in crimson gowns and
wigs.&rdquo; The courts were destroyed in 1867, and in
their place a Royal Court of Probate was established
at Westminster Hall.</p>
<p>According to the autographs on certain British
Museum readers&rsquo; slips, Charles Dickens was residing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
in 1831, at No. 10, Norfolk Street, Fitzroy Square,
the same street (now Cleveland Street, east side of
Middlesex Hospital) in which his father was domiciled
for a while in 1814.</p>
<p>About the year 1833 Charles rented bachelor
apartments in Cecil Street (Strand), as evidenced by
a letter of that period to an intimate friend, where
he says: &ldquo;The people at Cecil Street put too much
water in the hashes, lost the nutmeg-grater, attended
on me most miserably ... and so I gave them warning,
and have not yet fixed on a local habitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We learn from Charles Dickens the younger that
his father, before occupying chambers in Furnival&rsquo;s
Inn, had apartments in Buckingham Street, and it is,
therefore, not unlikely that he went thither from
Cecil Street; the same authority adds that &ldquo;if he
lived in David Copperfield&rsquo;s rooms&mdash;as I have no
doubt he did&mdash;he must have kept house on the top
floor of No. 15 on the east side&mdash;the house which
displays a tablet commemorating its one-time tenancy
by Peter the Great, Czar of all the Russias.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> David,
in describing his chambers, observes that &ldquo;they were
on the top of the house ... and consisted of a little
half-blind entry where you could see hardly anything,
a little stone-blind pantry where you could see nothing
at all, a sitting-room, and a bedroom. The furniture
was rather faded, but quite good enough for me;
and, sure enough, the river was outside the windows.&rdquo;
Here, or at Cecil Street, Dickens doubtless met that
martyr to &ldquo;the spazzums,&rdquo; the immortal Mrs. Crupp,
and the &ldquo;young gal&rdquo; whom she hired for festive
occasions, such as David&rsquo;s dinner-party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>In 1832, after gaining experience at Doctors&rsquo;
Commons, an opening was found for a reporter on
the staff of the <i>True Sun</i>, a London morning paper,
then just launched; and here it may be observed
that newspaper reporting in those days, before railways
and electric telegraphs, was not unattended by
great difficulties and even danger, for Dickens himself
relates how he had frequently to travel by post-chaise
to remote parts of the country to record
important speeches, and how, on the return journey,
he transcribed his notes on the palm of his hand by
the light of a dark lantern while galloping at fifteen
miles an hour at the dead of night through a wild
district, sometimes finding himself belated in miry
country roads during the small hours in a wheelless
carriage, with exhausted horses and drunken post-boys,
and then succeeding in reaching the office in
time for publication. While thus representing the
<i>True Sun</i> he joined the reporting staff of the <i>Mirror
of Parliament</i> (then a comparatively new paper, conducted
by his uncle, John Henry Barrow, barrister-at-law),
and in 1834 associated himself with the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> one of the leading London
journals, and a formidable rival of the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p class="pcap">1 RAYMOND BUILDINGS, GRAY&rsquo;S INN. (<i><a href="#Page_41">Page 41</a>.</i>)
<br />In the corner house were the offices of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, with whom Dickens was a clerk in 1827-1828.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>As a Parliamentary reporter he won great and
enviable distinction, it being an undoubted fact that
of the eighty or ninety so employed with him in the
&ldquo;gallery&rdquo; of the House of Commons, he retained
the premier position by reason of his marvellous
dexterity, accuracy, and capacity for work. It was,
of course, in the <i>old</i> House, not the present palatial
edifice, that Charles Dickens followed this avocation,
where the accommodation provided for the newspaper
representatives proved most unsatisfactory,
the &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; in the House of Lords being no
better than a &ldquo;preposterous pen&rdquo; (as Dickens
described it), in which the reporters were &ldquo;huddled
together like so many sheep,&rdquo; while the reporters
in the Commons carried on their duties in the
Strangers&rsquo; Gallery until a separate gallery was provided
for their use in the temporary House constructed
in 1834. The &ldquo;gentlemen of the press&rdquo;
are now treated with much greater consideration;
instead of the dark lobby, or &ldquo;pen,&rdquo; there are large
writing-rooms, separate apartments for smoking,
reading, dining, and dressing, as well as a stationer&rsquo;s
shop, a post-office, and a refreshment-bar.</p>
<p>Dickens&rsquo;s final appearance at the House of
Commons as a reporter was at the close of the
session of 1836, when, like David Copperfield, he
&ldquo;noted down the music of the Parliamentary bagpipes
for the last time.&rdquo; For he had already tasted
the delights of authorship, having written some
original papers for the <i>Evening Chronicle</i> and other
periodicals, and henceforth he determined to adopt
literature as a profession. His first paper appeared
(entitled &ldquo;A Dinner at Poplar Walk&rdquo;)<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> anonymously
in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> nearly three years prior to
his retirement from the Press Gallery&mdash;that is, in
December, 1833&mdash;and he has himself described how,
&ldquo;with fear and trembling,&rdquo; he stealthily dropped the
manuscript into &ldquo;a dark letter-box, in a dark office,
up a dark court in Fleet Street,&rdquo; and how suffused
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
with tears of joy and pride were the eyes of the
young author when he beheld his little effusion &ldquo;in
all the glory of print&rdquo; that &ldquo;they could not bear
the street and were not fit to be seen there.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;dark court&rdquo; referred to was Johnson&rsquo;s Court, Fleet
Street, the location of the office of the old (and long
since defunct) <i>Monthly Magazine</i>; the court still
exists, but the office was demolished quite recently
for the extension of the premises of Mr. Henry
Sells, who, happily, has preserved, as a memorial of
the novelist, the door to which the veritable &ldquo;dark
letter-box&rdquo; was attached. The story of Dickens&rsquo;s
early essays has often been related, and needs no
repetition here. Suffice it to say that upon the
success or failure of that maiden effort a very great
deal depended, as he intended to be guided by the
dictum of the publisher and of the public, and there
is every probability that, had this initial sketch been
unfavourably received, the young writer would have
directed his attention to the stage, which for him
always possessed a magnetic attraction; thus, instead
of becoming a famous author, he would have blossomed
into a popular actor, thereby missing his true vocation.</p>

<p>Dickens&rsquo;s earlier sketches (which bore no signature
until August, 1834, when he adopted the pseudonym
of &ldquo;Boz&rdquo;) were penned when living with his father
in Bentinck Street. At first they yielded no honorarium;
but as soon as he received a modest fee
for them in addition to his salary as a reporter, he
exhibited a sense of independence in resolving to
take the apartments in Buckingham Street, whence
he presently removed to more commodious chambers
in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, Holborn. He was then twenty-two
years of age, and still on the staff of the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, and from Christmas, 1834, he rented a
&ldquo;three-pair back&rdquo; at No. 13, Furnival&rsquo;s Inn. One
of his earliest (undated) letters bears the address of
Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, in which he informs his future brother-in-law,
Henry Austin, that he is about to start on a
journey, alone and in a gig, to Essex and Suffolk&mdash;evidently
on journalistic business for the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>&mdash;and expresses a belief that he would be
spilt before paying a turnpike, or run over a child
before reaching Chelmsford; his journey covered
the same ground as that performed by Mr. Pickwick
in his drive by coach to Ipswich. Twelve months
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
later he transferred his impedimenta from No. 13
to more cheerful rooms at No. 15, renting a &ldquo;three-pair
floor south.&rdquo; Several of the later &ldquo;Sketches by
Boz&rdquo; were doubtless written at No. 13, which stood
squeezed into a corner of the square on the right as
entered from Holborn, the young author&rsquo;s modest
quarters being almost at the top of a steep and dark
staircase.</p>
<p>His rooms at No. 15 were a decided improvement
on these, and he probably had them in his
mind when referring to Furnival&rsquo;s Inn in &ldquo;Martin
Chuzzlewit&rdquo; and to John Westlock&rsquo;s apartments
there, &ldquo;two stories up&rdquo;: &ldquo;There are snug chambers
in those Inns where the bachelors live, and, for the
dissolute fellows they pretend to be, it is quite surprising
how well they get on.... His rooms were
the perfection of neatness and convenience....
There is little enough to see in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn. It
is a shady, quiet place, echoing to the footsteps of
the stragglers who have business there, and rather
monotonous and gloomy on Sunday evenings.&rdquo; It
does not require much stretch of imagination to
believe that the description of Traddles&rsquo; chambers
in Gray&rsquo;s Inn (<i>vide</i> &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; chap. lix.)
was drawn from these very apartments, or to realize
the probability that the reference to Traddles and
his lovely girl guests is a reminiscence of Dickens&rsquo;s
own.</p>

<br />Charles Dickens lodged in the house overlooking the river about 1834, and Mrs. Crupps let apartments here to David Copperfield. This house was also occupied by Peter the Great, Henry Fielding, and William Black.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>This humble abode ever remained in his memory
as a hallowed spot, cherished by the fact that here
he received the commission to write &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;
and penned the opening chapters, by which immortal
achievement he suddenly leaped into fame;
but also by another interesting and very personal
recollection, namely, that it was the scene of his
early domestic life. For, be it remembered, the
publication of the first number of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;
(April, 1836) synchronized with his marriage, the
lady of his choice being Catherine Thomson Hogarth,
eldest daughter of George Hogarth, one of his colleagues
on the staff of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, the
ceremony being performed at the Church of St. Luke,
Chelsea, of which parish the Rev. Charles Kingsley
(father of the author of &ldquo;Westward Ho!&rdquo;) then
officiated as rector.</p>
<p>The honeymoon over, Dickens and his bride
returned to London, and made their home at No. 15,
Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, where their eldest child, Charles, was
born. Here his favourite sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth,
sometimes stayed with the youthful couple, her amiable
and delightful disposition proving a very joy in the
little household; her premature death in 1837, in
Doughty Street, at the age of seventeen, so unnerved
her admiring brother-in-law that the course of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo; (produced almost simultaneously)
was temporarily interrupted, and writing
presently to Mrs. Hogarth from his next abode, he
said: &ldquo;I wish you could know how I weary now for
the three rooms in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, and how I miss that
pleasant smile and those sweet words which, bestowed
upon our evening&rsquo;s work, on our merry banterings
round the fire, were more precious to me than the
applause of a whole world would be.&rdquo; Here, too
(as already mentioned), lived John Westlock when
visited by Tom Pinch, and it was the scene, also,
of certain incidents in &ldquo;The Mystery of Edwin
Drood.&rdquo; Does not Mr. Grewgious (whose chambers
were &ldquo;over the way&rdquo; at Staple Inn) tell us that
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
&ldquo;Furnival&rsquo;s is fireproof and specially watched and
lighted,&rdquo; and did he not escort Rosa Bud to her
rooms there, at Wood&rsquo;s Hotel in the Square, afterwards
confiding her to the care of the &ldquo;Unlimited
head chambermaid&rdquo;?<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>It was once an Inn of Chancery attached to Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn, deriving its name from Sir William Furnivall,
who owned much property hereabouts. About 1818
it became a series of chambers wholly unconnected
with any Inn of Court, and in that year was entirely
rebuilt by Peto. On the right-hand side of the
Square, as immediately entered from Holborn, the
house (No. 15) containing the bright little rooms
once tenanted by Dickens was easily identified in
later years by the medallion above the ground-floor
windows which notified the fact; this house and its
neighbour were more ornate than the rest, by reason
of the series of Ionic pilasters between the windows.
The whole of Furnival&rsquo;s Inn was swept away in 1898,
and the site covered by an extension of the premises
of the Prudential Insurance Company; thus, alas!
disappears an extremely interesting Dickens landmark,
so intimately associated with the novelist and
his writings.</p>
<p>Dickens must have relinquished his tenancy of the
chambers in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn before the actual term had
expired, the assumption being that he had taken
them on a short lease, as, according to the official
record, he continued to pay rent until February
1839. Two years previously, finding this accommodation
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
inadequate, and realizing that his literary
labours had already begun to yield a good income,
he determined to take a house, No. 48, Doughty
Street, Mecklenburgh Square&mdash;a locality not otherwise
unknown to literary fame; for Shirley Brooks
(a former editor of <i>Punch</i>) was born in this street,
while both Sydney Smith and Edmund Yates lived
there, the latter at No. 43,<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> opposite Tegg, the
publisher of the &ldquo;Peter Parley&rdquo; series of juvenile
books.</p>
<p>Yates, in his &ldquo;Recollections and Experiences,&rdquo;
recalls the Doughty Street of his day (and of
Dickens&rsquo;s) as &ldquo;a broad, airy, wholesome street;
none of your common thoroughfares, to be rattled
through by vulgar cabs and earth-shaking Pickford
vans, but a self-included property, with a
gate at each end, and a lodge with a porter in
a gold-laced hat and the Doughty arms<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> on the
buttons of his mulberry-coloured coat, to prevent
anyone, except with a mission to one of the houses,
from intruding on the exclusive territory.&rdquo; The
lodges and gates have been removed since this
was written, and the porter in official garb disappeared
with that exclusiveness and quietude which
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
doubtless attracted Dickens to the spot more than
sixty years ago.</p>
<p>No. 48, Doughty Street (where his daughters Mary
and Kate were born) is situated on the east side of
the street, and contains twelve rooms&mdash;a single-fronted,
three-storied house, with a railed-in area in
front and a small garden at the rear. A tiny little
room on the ground-floor, facing the garden, is
believed to have been the novelist&rsquo;s study, in which
he wrote the latter portion of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; and
practically the whole of &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby.&rdquo; The summer months he
customarily spent away from home, taking his work
with him, and thus a few chapters of these books
were penned at Broadstairs, at Twickenham Park,
and at Elm Cottage (now called Elm Lodge),
Petersham, a pretty little rural retreat rented by him
in the summer of 1839, a locality to which he then
referred as &ldquo;those remote and distant parts, with the
chain of mountains formed by Richmond Hill
presenting an almost insurmountable barrier between
me and the busy world.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>At Elm Cottage he frequently enjoyed the society
of his friends&mdash;Maclise, Landseer, Ainsworth,
Talfourd, and the rest&mdash;many of whom joined
in athletic competitions organized by their energetic
host in the extensive grounds, among other frivolities
being a balloon club for children, of which Forster
was elected president on condition that he supplied
all the balloons. Elm Cottage (Lodge) is now a
school, screened from the public road by a high
wooden fence and a barrier of elm-trees; it is a
heavy-looking structure, roofed with red tiles, and at
the rear is Sudbrook Lane. The novelist&rsquo;s first
country home, however, was at No. 4, Ailsa Park
Villas, Twickenham, still standing in the Isleworth
Road,<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> near St. Margaret&rsquo;s railway-station, described
in a recent issue of the <i>Richmond and Twickenham
Times</i> as &ldquo;a building on regular lines, shut in from
the world by a plenitude of trees, silent and quiet,
an ideal cottage for a mind seeking rest and repose;&rdquo;
not a picturesque edifice by any means, but having
a quaint entablature with a circular window in the
centre thereof, the house having since undergone
little or no change, except, perhaps, in the enlargement
of the balcony over the main entrance. There are
several references in Dickens&rsquo;s early letters to this
region of the Thames Valley (to the Star and
Garter, at Richmond, Eel Pie Island, etc.), and much
local colouring is employed in certain of his novels&mdash;&ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby,&rdquo; &ldquo;Little Dorrit,&rdquo; and especially
in &ldquo;Oliver Twist.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> It is interesting to know that
the Old Coach and Horses at Isleworth, where
Sikes and Oliver halted during the burglary expedition
to Chertsey, remains almost intact to this day,
opposite Syon Lane, and contiguous to Syon House,
the residence of that popular writer of fiction, Mr.
George Manville Fenn.<a class="fn" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>It was during the Doughty Street days that
Dickens, in order to relieve the mental tension,
indulged in many enjoyable jaunts into the country
with Forster, these acting as a stimulant to fresh
exertion. He either rode on horseback or walked to
such outlying districts as Hampstead, Barnet, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
Richmond, his favourite haunt in the northern
suburb being Jack Straw&rsquo;s Castle on the Heath,
famous also for its associations with Thackeray, Du
Maurier, and Lord Leighton, and commemorated a
generation before by Washington Irving in his &ldquo;Tales
of a Traveller.&rdquo; Here the Dickens traditions are still
cherished, a small upper apartment in front being
pointed out as the bedroom which he occasionally
occupied. &ldquo;I knows a good &rsquo;ous there,&rdquo; he said to
Forster when imploring his companionship on a bout
to Hampstead, &ldquo;where we can have a red-hot chop
for dinner and a glass of wine&rdquo;; and the notification
resulted in many happy meetings there in the coming
years.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> A writer in the <i>Daily Graphic</i> (July 18, 1903)
avers that Hampstead possesses other Dickensian
associations&mdash;that the novelist had lodgings at
Wylde&rsquo;s Farm, and, it is said, wrote some chapters
of &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; in the picturesque cottage, which,
with the farmhouse and land, it is proposed to
acquire for the use and enjoyment of the public.
Wylde&rsquo;s Farm is situated on the north-west boundary
of Hampstead Heath, close to North End, Hampstead;
it formerly consisted of two farms, one
known as Collins&rsquo;s and the other as Tooley&rsquo;s, and it
was at Collins&rsquo;s that John Linnell, the artist, lived
for some years, and there welcomed, as visitors,
William Blake, Mulready, Flaxman, George Morland,
and others distinguished in Art and Literature.</p>

<p class="pcap">48 DOUGHTY STREET. (<i><a href="#Page_54">Page 54</a>.</i>)
<br />The residence of Charles Dickens, 1837-1839. His only London residence which remains unchanged. Part of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; and the greater part of &ldquo;Nickleby&rdquo; were written here.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The associations of the novelist with No. 48,
Doughty Street are perpetuated not only in the
name &ldquo;Dickens House&rdquo; recently bestowed upon it,
but by the tablet affixed thereon by the London
County Council in December last&mdash;truly, a long-delayed
tribute, and especially deserving in this case
owing to the fact that it is the only London home
of Charles Dickens which survives intact structurally.
It was here that in September, 1838, Forster lunched
with him, and then to sit, read, or work, &ldquo;or do
something&rdquo; (as the author expressed it in his note
of invitation), &ldquo;while I write the <i>last</i> chapter of
&lsquo;Oliver,&rsquo; which will be arter a lamb chop.&rdquo; &ldquo;How
well I remember that evening!&rdquo; observes his friend,
&ldquo;and our talk of what should be the fate of Charley
Bates, on behalf of whom (as, indeed, for the Dodger,
too) Talfourd<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> had pleaded as earnestly in mitigation
of judgment as ever at the bar for any client he had
most respected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing to his friend Macready, the actor, in
November, 1839, Dickens said: &ldquo;You must come
and see my new house when we have it to rights.&rdquo;
He had just completed the last number of &ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby,&rdquo; when he decided to leave Doughty Street
for a more commodious residence in a more exclusive
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
neighbourhood, namely, No. 1, Devonshire Terrace,
York Gate&mdash;&ldquo;a house of great promise (and great
premium), undeniable situation, and excessive splendour,&rdquo;
to quote his own concise description; it had
a large garden, and was shut out from the New
Road (now the Marylebone Road) by a high brick
wall facing the York Gate into Regent&rsquo;s Park. In
&ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller,&rdquo; Dickens refers to
&ldquo;having taken the lease of a house in a certain
distinguished Metropolitan parish&mdash;a house which
then appeared to me to be a frightfully first-class
Family Mansion, involving awful responsibilities.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>

<br /><i>From a print in the collection of Councillor Newton, Hampstead.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>A contemporary drawing of the house by Daniel
Maclise, R.A., represents it as detached and standing
in its own grounds, with a wrought-iron entrance-gate
surmounted by a lamp-bracket; the building
consisted of a basement, two stories, and an attic.
There are only three houses in the Terrace, and
immediately beyond is the burial-ground of St.
Marylebone Church.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> No. 1, Devonshire Terrace
is now semi-detached, having a line of taller residential
structures on the southern side, while a
portion of the high brick wall on the Terrace side
has been replaced by an iron railing. The house
itself has been structurally changed since Dickens&rsquo;s
days, and has undergone enlargement, a new story
being inserted between the ground-floor and the
upper story, thus considerably altering its original
proportions without actually removing its principal
features. Mr. Hughes, who in 1888 examined
the house prior to these &ldquo;improvements,&rdquo; states
that it then contained thirteen rooms. &ldquo;The
polished mahogany doors in the hall, and the chaste
Italian marble mantelpieces in the principal rooms,
are said to have been put up by the novelist. On
the ground-floor the smaller room to the eastward
of the house, with windows facing north and
looking into the pleasant garden, where the plane-trees
and turf are beautifully green, is pointed out
as having been his study.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> Concerning Dickens&rsquo;s
studies, his eldest daughter tells us that they &ldquo;were
always cheery, pleasant rooms, and always, like himself,
the personification of neatness and tidiness. On
the shelf of his writing-table were many dainty and
useful ornaments&mdash;gifts from his friends or members
of his family&mdash;and always a vase of bright and fresh
flowers.&rdquo; Referring to the sanctum at Devonshire
Terrace, Miss Dickens observes that it (the first she
could remember) was &ldquo;a pretty room, with steps
leading directly into the garden from it, and with an
extra baize door to keep out all sounds and noise.&rdquo;
The garden here constituted a great attraction to
Dickens, for it enabled him, with his children and
friends, to indulge in such simple games as battledore
and shuttlecock and bowls, which not only
delighted him, but conveniently afforded means of
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
obtaining necessary exercise and recreation at intervals
during his literary labours.</p>
<p>In a stable on the south side of the garden were
kept the two ravens that inspired the conception of
Grip in &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; of which famous bird
they were the &ldquo;great originals.&rdquo; Longfellow, after
visiting the novelist here in 1841, said in a letter to
a friend: &ldquo;I write this from Dickens&rsquo;s study, the
focus from which so many luminous things have
radiated. The raven croaks in the garden, and the
ceaseless roar of London fills my ears.&rdquo; The first
raven died in 1841 from the effects (it was believed)
of a meal of white paint; he was quickly succeeded
by an older and a larger raven (&ldquo;comparatively of
weak intellect&rdquo;), whose decease in 1845 was similarly
premature, probably owing to &ldquo;the same illicit taste
for putty and paint which had been fatal to his predecessor.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Voracity killed him,&rdquo; said Dickens,
&ldquo;as it did Scott&rsquo;s; he died unexpectedly by the
kitchen fire. He kept his eye to the last upon the
meat as it roasted, and suddenly turned over on his
back with a sepulchral cry of &lsquo;Cuckoo.&rsquo;&rdquo; The
novelist occupied No. 1, Devonshire Terrace (the
scene of many of his literary triumphs) for a period
of about twelve years&mdash;the happiest period of his
life&mdash;and there wrote some of the best of his stories,
including &ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop,&rdquo; &ldquo;Barnaby
Rudge,&rdquo; &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dombey and Son,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; the latter the most delightful
of all his books, and his own favourite.
Here also he composed those ever-popular Yule-tide
annuals, &ldquo;A Christmas Carol,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Cricket on the
Hearth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Haunted Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friends which the fame of the young author
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
attracted thither included some of the most distinguished
men of the day, such as Macready, Talfourd,
Proctor (&ldquo;Barry Cornwall&rdquo;), Clarkson Stanfield, R.A.,
Sir David Wilkie, R.A., Sir Edwin Landseer, R.A.,
Samuel Rogers, Sydney Smith, and many others of
equal note, for which reason, among others, he
always cherished fond recollections of this London
home, and writing to Forster from Genoa in 1844,
he could not refrain from expressing how strangely
he felt in the midst of such unfamiliar environment.
&ldquo;I seem,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as if I had plucked myself out
of my proper soil when I left Devonshire Terrace,
and would take root no more until I return to it....
Did I tell you how many fountains we have here?
No matter. If they played nectar they wouldn&rsquo;t
please me half so well as the West Middlesex Waterworks
at Devonshire Terrace.&rdquo; As in the case of
48, Doughty Street, this house bears a commemorative
tablet, placed by the London County Council.
It is interesting to add that within a stone&rsquo;s-throw
stands the old parish church of St. Marylebone,
the scene of the burial of little Paul Dombey
and his mother, and of Mr. Dombey&rsquo;s second
marriage.</p>
<p>At Devonshire Terrace four sons were born to
him, viz., Walter Landor, Francis Jeffrey, Alfred
Tennyson, Henry Fielding, and one daughter, Dora
Annie, who survived only a few months.</p>
<p>On particular occasions, owing to a prolonged
absence from England, he let this house firstly to
General Sir John Wilson in 1842 (when he first
visited America); secondly, to a widow lady, who
agreed to occupy it during his stay in Italy in 1844;
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
and, thirdly, in 1846, to Sir James Duke. The
widow lady took possession a week or two before he
started for the Continent, thus compelling him to
seek temporary quarters elsewhere. He found the
necessary accommodation near at hand, namely, at
No. 9, Osnaburgh Terrace, New Road (now Euston
Road), which he rented for the interval. Here
occurred an amusing contretemps. Before entering
upon this brief tenancy, he had invited a number of
valued friends to a farewell dinner prior to his departure
for Italy, and suddenly discovered that,
owing to the small dimensions of the rooms, he
would be obliged to abandon or postpone the function,
the house having no convenience &ldquo;for the production
of any other banquet than a cold collation
of plate and linen, the only comforts we have not
left behind us.&rdquo; Additional help being obtained,
however, the dinner went off satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Dickens and his family left England for Italy in
July, 1844, remaining abroad for a period of twelve
months. In November, however, he made a quick
journey to London, in order to test the effect of a
reading aloud of his just completed Christmas book,
&ldquo;The Chimes,&rdquo; before a few friends assembled for
that purpose at Forster&rsquo;s residence, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
Fields, which, as readers of &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; may
remember, is introduced into that story as Mr.
Tulkinghorn&rsquo;s Chambers. The pleasurable interlude
over, the novelist returned to Genoa, there remaining
until June, 1845, when, homesick and eager to renew
the &ldquo;happy old walks and old talks&rdquo; with his friends
in the &ldquo;dear old home,&rdquo; he gladly settled down again
in Devonshire Terrace. But only eleven months
elapsed before he departed for Switzerland, where he
rented a little villa called Rosemont at Lausanne;
here he embarked upon a new story, &ldquo;Dombey and
Son,&rdquo; and wrote &ldquo;The Battle of Life.&rdquo; His stay on
the Continent was unexpectedly curtailed by the
illness from scarlet fever of his eldest son Charles,
then at King&rsquo;s College school in London, whereupon,
at the end of February, 1847, the novelist and his
wife hastily made their way to the bedside of their
sick boy, taking up their abode at the Victoria Hotel,
Euston Square,<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> the Devonshire Terrace home being
still occupied by Sir James Duke. The little invalid
was under the care of his grandmother, Mrs. Hogarth,
in Albany Street, Regent&rsquo;s Park, and Dickens secured
temporary quarters near at hand, in Chester Place,
where he remained until June, and where a fifth
son was born, christened Sydney Smith Haldemand.</p>

<p class="pcap">1 DEVONSHIRE TERRACE. (<i><a href="#Page_58">Page 58</a>.</i>)
<br />The residence of Dickens, 1839-1851. Some of his finest books were written here.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Writing to Mrs. Hogarth from Chester Place (the
number is not recorded), he said: &ldquo;This house is
very cheerful on the drawing-room floor and above,
looking into the park on one side and Albany Street
on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early in 1848 Devonshire Terrace was quitted by
Sir James Duke, and Dickens returned to London
from Brighton (where he had been spending two or
three weeks) joyfully to enter into possession once
more of his own home, taking with him for completion
an important chapter of &ldquo;Dombey and Son.&rdquo;
The lease of this house expired in 1851, the last
book written there being &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; at
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the publication of which his reputation attained its
highest level. He now realized that, for a family
consisting of six sons and two daughters (of whom
the eldest, Charles Culliford Boz, was but fourteen
years of age), this residence did not offer sufficient
accommodation, and therefore he decided with keen
regret not to renew the lease.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> Indeed, from the
beginning of the year he had been negotiating for a
more commodious domicile, Tavistock House, in
Tavistock Square, then, and for some years previously,
the residence of his cherished artist friend,
Frank Stone, A.R.A., father of Mr. Marcus Stone,
the Royal Academician. An opportunity arising
for the immediate purchase of the lease of Tavistock
House, Dickens felt convinced it was prudent that
he should buy it, for, as he observed in a letter to
Frank Stone, it seemed very unlikely that he would
obtain &ldquo;the same comforts for the rising generation
elsewhere for the same money,&rdquo; and gave him carte-blanche
to make the necessary arrangements for
acquiring the lease at a price not exceeding &pound;1,500.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make any apologies,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for
thrusting this honour upon you, knowing what a
thorough-going old pump you are.&rdquo; After securing
the property, the summer months were spent by the
novelist at Broadstairs, where a &ldquo;dim vision&rdquo; suddenly
confronted him in connection with the impending
change of residence. &ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; he wrote
considerately to Stone, &ldquo;you should find, on looking
forward, a probability of your being houseless at
Michaelmas, what do you say to using Devonshire
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
Terrace as a temporary encampment? It will not
be in its usual order, but we would take care that
there should be as much useful furniture of all sorts
there as to render it unnecessary for you to move a
stick. If you should think this a convenience, then
I should propose to you to pile your furniture in
the middle of the rooms at Tavistock House, and go
out to Devonshire Terrace two or three weeks <i>before</i>
Michaelmas, to enable my workmen to commence
their operations. This might be to our mutual convenience,
and therefore I suggest it. Certainly, the
sooner I can begin on Tavistock House the better,
and possibly your going into Devonshire Terrace
might relieve you from a difficulty that would otherwise
be perplexing. I make this suggestion (I need
not say to <i>you</i>) solely on the chance of its being
useful to both of us. If it were merely convenient
to me, you know I shouldn&rsquo;t dream of it. Such an
arrangement, while it would cost you nothing, would
perhaps enable you to get your new house into order
comfortably, and do exactly the same thing for me.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a>
The exchange was accordingly made, so enabling
Dickens to effect certain structural improvements in
Tavistock House before returning from Broadstairs
to take possession in November. These alterations
and reparations, which were apparently on a somewhat
extensive scale, were carried out under the
superintendence of his brother-in-law, Henry Austin,
an architect and sanitary engineer, to whom Dickens
(harassed by delays in the work) wrote despairingly
as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in that state of mind which you may
(once) have seen described in the newspapers as
&lsquo;bordering on distraction,&rsquo; the house given up to
me, the fine weather going on (soon to break, I dare
say), the printing season oozing away, my new book
(&lsquo;Bleak House&rsquo;) waiting to be born, and</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;<i>No Workmen on the Premises</i>,</p>
<p>along of my not hearing from you!! I have torn
all my hair off, and constantly beat my unoffending
family. Wild notions have occurred to me of sending
in my own plumber to do the drains. Then I remember
that you have probably written to propose
<i>your</i> man, and restrain my audacious hand. Then
Stone presents himself, with a most exasperatingly
mysterious visage, and says that a rat has appeared
in the kitchen, and it&rsquo;s his opinion (Stone&rsquo;s, not the
rat&rsquo;s) that the drains want &lsquo;compo-ing&rsquo;; for the use
of which explicit language I could fell him without
remorse. In my horrible desire to &lsquo;compo&rsquo; everything,
the very postman becomes my enemy, because
he brings no letter from you; and, in short, I don&rsquo;t
see what&rsquo;s to become of me unless I hear from you
to-morrow, which I have not the least expectation of
doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going over the house again, I have materially
altered the plans, abandoned conservatory and front
balcony, decided to make Stone&rsquo;s painting-room the
drawing-room (it is nearly 6 inches higher than the
room below), to carry the entrance passage right
through the house to a back door leading to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
garden, and to reduce the once intended drawing-room&mdash;now
schoolroom&mdash;to a manageable size,
making a door of communication between the new
drawing-room and the study. Curtains and carpets,
on a scale of awful splendour and magnitude, are
already in preparation, and still&mdash;still&mdash;</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;<i>No Workmen on the Premises.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;To pursue this theme is madness. Where are
you? When are you coming home? Where is <i>the</i>

an army of artificers must be turned in at once, and
the whole thing finished out of hand?</p>

<p>Other letters followed, testifying to the highly
nervous condition and impatience of the writer, who
in certain of these characteristic missives, said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am perpetually wandering (in fancy) up and down
the house (Tavistock House) and tumbling over the
workmen; when I feel that they are gone to dinner,
I become low; when I look forward to their total
abstinence on Sundays, I am wretched. The gravy
at dinner has a taste of glue in it. I smell paint in
the sea. Phantom lime attends me all the day long.
I dream that I am a carpenter, and can&rsquo;t partition off
the hall. I frequently dance (with a distinguished
company) in the dressing-room, and fall in the kitchen
for want of a pillar.... I dream, also, of the
workmen every night. They make faces at me, and
won&rsquo;t do anything.... Oh! if this were to last long;
the distractions of the new book, the whirling of the
story through one&rsquo;s mind, escorted by workmen, the
imbecility, the wild necessity of beginning to write,
the not being able to do so, the&mdash;O! I should
go&mdash;&mdash;O!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<p class="tb">The house, after all, was not ready to receive him
at the stipulated time, for it proved to be as difficult
to get the workmen off the premises as to get them
on, and at the end of October they were still busy in
their own peculiar manner, the painters mislaying
their brushes every five minutes, and chiefly whistling
in the intervals, while the carpenters &ldquo;continued to
look sideways with one eye down pieces of wood, as
if they were absorbed in the contemplation of the
perspective of the Thames Tunnel, and had entirely
relinquished the vanities of this transitory world.&rdquo;
With white lime in the kitchens, blank paper constantly
spread on drawing-room walls and shred off
again, men clinking at the new stair-rails, Irish
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
labourers howling in the schoolroom (&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
know why&rdquo;), the gardener vigorously lopping the
trees, something like pandemonium reigned supreme,
and the &ldquo;Inimitable&rdquo; mentally blessed the day when
silence and order at length succeeded, permitting
him once more to settle down to his desk, and to
concentrate his thoughts upon the new serial, &ldquo;Bleak
House,&rdquo; the writing of which was begun at the end
of November, 1851&mdash;on a Friday, too, regarded by
him as his lucky day.</p>
<p>Tavistock House,<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a>
with Russell House and Bedford
House adjoining (all the property of the Duke
of Bedford and all demolished), stood at the northeast
corner of the private, secluded Tavistock Square
(named after the Marquis of Tavistock, father of the
celebrated William, Lord Russell), a short distance
south of Euston Road, about midway between Euston
Square and the aristocratic Russell Square, and railed
off from Upper Woburn Place.</p>
<p>The exterior of Tavistock House (pulled down
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
in 1901) presented a plain brick structure of two
stories in height above the ground-floor, with attics
in the roof, an open portico or porch being added by
a later tenant; it contained no less than eighteen
rooms, including a drawing-room capable of holding
more than three hundred persons. On the garden
side, at the rear, the house had a bowed front somewhat
resembling that at Devonshire Terrace. Hans
Christian Andersen, who visited him here in 1857,
has left us a delightful record of his impressions of
the mansion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Tavistock Square stands Tavistock House.
This and the strip of garden in front are shut out
from the thoroughfare (Gordon Place, on the east
side) by an iron railing. A large garden, with a
grass plot and high trees, stretches behind the house,
and gives it a countrified look in the midst of this
coal and gas-steaming London. In the passage
from street to garden hung pictures and engravings.
Here stood a marble bust of Dickens, so like him, so
youthful and handsome; and over a bedroom door
were inserted the bas-reliefs of Night and Day, after
Thorwaldsen.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> On the first floor was a rich library,
with a fireplace and a writing-table, looking out on
the garden.... The kitchen was underground,
and at the top of the house were bedrooms. I had
a snug room looking out on the garden, and over
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
the tree-tops I saw the London towers and spires
appear and disappear as the weather cleared or
thickened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dickens&rsquo;s eldest daughter, in recalling her father&rsquo;s
study at Tavistock House, remembered it as being
larger and more ornate than his previous sanctum,
and describes it as &ldquo;a fine large room, opening into
the drawing-room by means of sliding doors. When
the rooms were thrown together,&rdquo; she adds, &ldquo;they
gave my father a promenade of considerable length
for the constant indoor walking which formed a
favourite recreation for him after a hard day&rsquo;s
writing.&rdquo; Here were wholly or partly written some
of his best stories&mdash;viz., &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hard
Times,&rdquo; &ldquo;Little Dorrit,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Great Expectations,&rdquo; his labours being agreeably
diversified by private theatricals.</p>
<p>With a view to possibilities of this kind, he caused
the school-room (on the ground-floor at the back of
the house) to be adapted for such entertainments by
having a stage erected and a platform built outside
the window for scenic purposes. His older children
(the last of the family, Edward Bulwer Lytton, was
born in Tavistock House, 1852) had now attained
an age that justified a demand for a special form of
home amusement, and this met with a ready response
from an indulgent father, who, mainly, if not entirely,
for their delight, arranged for a series of juvenile
theatricals, which began on the first Twelfth Night
there (the eldest son&rsquo;s fifteenth birthday) with a performance
of Fielding&rsquo;s burlesque, &ldquo;Tom Thumb,&rdquo;
with Mark Lemon and Dickens himself in the cast.
Thackeray, who was present, thoroughly enjoyed the
fun, rolling off his seat in a burst of laughter at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
absurdity of the thing. Play-bills were printed, and
every detail carried out in the orthodox style, for
Dickens (who, as &ldquo;Lessee and Manager,&rdquo; humorously
styled himself &ldquo;Mr. Crummies&rdquo;) entered heart and
soul into the business, and as thoroughly as if his
income solely depended on it&mdash;this was entirely
characteristic of the man.</p>
<p>For the time being, the house was given up to
theatrical preparations; the schoolroom became a
painter&rsquo;s shop; there was a gasfitters shop all over
the basement; the topmost rooms were devoted to
dressmaking, and the novelist&rsquo;s dressing-room to
tailoring, while he himself at intervals did his best
to write &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; in corners, &ldquo;like the
Sultan&rsquo;s groom, who was turned upside-down by the
genii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most remarkable performances at &ldquo;The
Smallest Theatre in the World&rdquo;! (for so the play-bills
described it) were the presentations of &ldquo;The
Lighthouse&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Frozen Deep,&rdquo; plays
specially written by Wilkie Collins, for which the
scenes were painted by Clarkson Stanfield, R.A.,
one of these beautiful works of art (depicting the
Eddystone Lighthouse) realizing a thousand guineas
after the novelist&rsquo;s death! These theatrical entertainments,
continued on Twelfth Nights for many
years, were witnessed and enjoyed by many notabilities
of London (Carlyle among them), and created
quite a public sensation.</p>
<p>Dickens&rsquo;s cherished friend, the late Miss Mary
Boyle, had vivid and pleasing recollections of
Tavistock House and the master spirit who presided
over it.</p>

<br />The residence of Dickens, 1851-1860.
<br /><i>From a photograph by Catherine Weed Barnes Ward.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;The very sound of the name,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;is
replete to me with memories of innumerable evenings
passed in the most congenial and delightful intercourse&mdash;dinners
where the guests vied with each
other in brilliant conversation, whether intellectual,
witty, or sparkling; evenings devoted to music or
theatricals. First and foremost of that magic circle
was the host himself, always &lsquo;one of us,&rsquo; who
invariably drew out what was best and most characteristic
in others.... I can never forget one
evening, shortly after the arrival at Tavistock House,
when we danced in the New Year. It seemed like
a page cut out of the &lsquo;Christmas Carol,&rsquo; as far, at
least, as fun and frolic went.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>It was while living at Tavistock House that
Dickens devised the series of imitation book-backs
with incongruous titles which were to serve as a
decorative feature in his study, and were afterwards
transferred, together with Clarkson Stanfield&rsquo;s
scenery, to his next home. Here, too, he gave
sittings for his portrait to E. M. Ward, R.A., in
1854, in which is seen the strongly-contrasting tints
of curtains, carpet, and other accessories, indicating
the great writer&rsquo;s passion for colour. The background
and other details in the portrait by Mr. W. P.
Frith, R.A., in 1859, were also painted in Dickens&rsquo;s
study at Tavistock House while he was at work. It
has been suggested that the novelist probably found
this residence a little too convenient for friends and
other callers, whose unexpected visits somewhat
interrupted him, and that this may have been a
reason for his exodus into the country.</p>
<p>In 1855 the novelist ascertained that a picturesque
house at Gad&rsquo;s Hill, near Rochester, the possession
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
of which he declared to be a dream of his childhood,
was to be sold, and he at once determined to buy it
if possible. In this he succeeded, but it was not
until 1860 that he finally left his London abode to
make his home at his &ldquo;little Kentish freehold.&rdquo;
During part of the interval he divided his favours
between Tavistock House and Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place,
usually spending the summer months at his country
retreat, furnished merely as a temporary summer
residence until September, 1860, when he disposed of
the remainder of the lease of the London house to
Mr. Davis, a Jewish gentleman. Concerning the
transaction, he wrote (on the 4th of the month) to
his henchman, W. H. Wills: &ldquo;Tavistock House is
cleared to-day, and possession delivered up. I must
say that in all things the purchaser has behaved
thoroughly well, and that I cannot call to mind any
occasion when I have had money dealings with a
Christian that have been so satisfactory, considerate,
and trusting.&rdquo; His occupation of Tavistock House
covered a period of exactly ten years.</p>

<p class="pcap">5 HYDE PARK PLACE (NOW 5 MARBLE ARCH). (<i><a href="#Page_77">Page 77</a>.</i>)
<br />The centre house, without a porch, was the residence of Dickens in the early part of 1870.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>In 1885 and subsequently Tavistock House was
occupied as a Jewish College, and it is worthy of
note that prior to that date it was tenanted by
Gounod, the composer, and by Mrs. Georgina
Weldon, the well-known lady litigant, who in
1880 privately issued an extraordinary pamphlet
entitled &ldquo;The Ghastly Consequences of Living in
Charles Dickens&rsquo;s House,&rdquo; where she dilates upon
an attempt made to forcibly convey her to a lunatic
asylum.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<p>Tavistock House, with its neighbours Bedford
House and Russell House, were razed to the ground
about four years ago, and the land, to be let on a
building lease, is still a desolate waste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Although definitely settled at Gad&rsquo;s Hill, Dickens
decided upon taking a furnished house in town for
a few months of the London season for the sake of
his daughters, then young ladies just emerged from
their teens, and the younger of whom was then
engaged to be married. Accordingly, in the spring
months of 1861 we find him and his household
established at No. 3, Hanover Terrace, Regent&rsquo;s
Park, a retired spot adjoining the western side of
the Park. In February, 1862, he made an exchange
of houses for three months with his friends Mr. and
Mrs. Hogge, they going to Gad&rsquo;s Hill, and he and
his family to Mr. Hogge&rsquo;s house at No. 16, Hyde
Park Gate, South Kensington Gore (south side of
Kensington High Street); for, as the novelist explained,
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
his unmarried daughter naturally liked to
be in town at that time of the year. In the middle
of February, 1864, he removed to another London
mansion, No. 57, Gloucester Place, north of Hyde
Park, where he stayed until June, busily engaged
during those months with &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend.&rdquo;
Gloucester Place now forms part of Gloucester
Terrace, near Bayswater Road, and the northern
end of the Serpentine.</p>
<p>For the spring of 1865 a furnished house was
taken at No. 16, Somers Place, north of Hyde
Park (between Cambridge Square and Southwick
Crescent), which Dickens, with his sister-in-law and
daughter, occupied from the beginning of March
until June, while Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place was being
&ldquo;gorgeously painted,&rdquo; as he informed Macready,
with a further intimation that, owing to great
suffering in his foot, he was a terror to the household,
likewise to all the organs and brass bands
in this quarter. In 1866 he rented for the spring
a furnished house at No. 6, Southwick Place, Hyde
Park Square (contiguous to his former residence in
Somers Place), and early in January, 1870 (five
months before his death), he took for the season
the classic-fronted mansion of his friends Mr. and
Mrs. Milner-Gibson, at No. 5, Hyde Park Place,
apropos of which he said in a letter to his American
friend James T. Fields: &ldquo;We live here (opposite
the Marble Arch) in a charming house until the
1st of June, and then return to Gad&rsquo;s.... I have
a large room here, with three fine windows, overlooking
the Park, unsurpassable for airiness and
cheerfulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This house was Charles Dickens&rsquo;s last London
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
residence; he rented it, Forster tells us, for the
period of his London Readings at that time, in order
to avoid the daily railway journey to London from
Gad&rsquo;s Hill, entertaining an especial dislike to that
mode of travelling in the then serious state of his
health.</p>
<p>At Hyde Park Place he wrote a considerable
portion of the unfinished fragment of &ldquo;The Mystery
of Edwin Drood,&rdquo; and made the acquaintance,
through his friend Sir John Millais, of the illustrator
of that story, Mr. Luke Fildes, now the well-known
Royal Academician, who cherishes the most pleasant
recollections of the collaboration.</p>
<p>We learn that in 1867 and 1869 Dickens did not
take a house in London, as was customary in these
later years. In May of 1869 he stayed with his
daughter and sister-in-law for two or three weeks at
the St. James&rsquo;s Hotel (now the Berkeley), at the
corner of Berkeley Street, Piccadilly, having promised
to be in London at the time of the arrival of a
number of American friends; in order, too, that he
might be near his London doctor for a while,<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> and
be able to avail himself of invitations from innumerable
familiar acquaintances.</p>
<p>In 1867, having a series of Readings in town and
country alternately, he decided to dispense with unnecessary
travelling between Gad&rsquo;s Hill and London
by sleeping in bachelor quarters at the office of his
weekly journal, <i>All the Year Round</i>, which succeeded
the earlier publication, <i>Household Words</i>,
in 1859.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">

<p class="pcap">THE OFFICE OF &ldquo;ALL THE YEAR ROUND,&rdquo;
<br />26 (FORMERLY 11) WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND. (<i><a href="#Page_78">Page 78</a>.</i>)
<br />In 1860 Dickens furnished rooms here, which were &ldquo;Really a success. As comfortable, cheerful, and private as anything of the kind can possibly be&rdquo; (letter to Miss Mamie Dickens).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The office of <i>All the Year Round</i> was then No. 11,
Wellington Street, North Strand, and still exists as
No. 26, Wellington Street, at the south corner of
Tavistock Street, at its junction with Wellington
Street. In 1872 the lessee of the property was
unavailingly approached by emissaries from Chicago
with the view of purchasing and transporting the
building to the <i>World&rsquo;s Fair</i>, as a memento of the
novelist. For his own convenience Dickens furnished
rooms here,<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> to be used as bedroom and sitting-room
as occasion required, which must have reminded him
of those early days when he lived in similar bachelor
apartments at Furnival&rsquo;s Inn. Happily for him, his
creature comforts were ensured by an old and tried
servant&mdash;a paragon&mdash;whom Dickens declared to be
&ldquo;the cleverest man of his kind in the world,&rdquo; and
able to do anything, &ldquo;from excellent carpentry to
excellent cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The office of <i>Household Words</i> was situated in
Wellington Street, Strand, nearly opposite the portico
of the Lyceum Theatre, a short distance from the
Strand on the right-hand side of the way, and was
rendered somewhat conspicuous by a large bow
window. This building stood on the site of a very
old tenement, with which there was bound up a very
weird London legend, setting forth how the room
on the first-floor front was the identical apartment
which had served Hogarth as the scene of the final
tableau in &ldquo;The Harlot&rsquo;s Progress.&rdquo; The novelist
used to tell his contributors that he had often, while
sitting in his editorial sanctum, conjured up mental
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
pictures of Kate Hackabout lying dead in her coffin,
wept over by drunken beldames.</p>
<p>On September 17, 1903, the London County
Council&rsquo;s housebreakers took possession of the old
office of <i>Household Words</i> (whence in 1850 Dickens
launched the first number of that periodical), and
the building has since been sacrificed in the general
scheme for providing a new thoroughfare from the
Strand to Holborn. Dickens used the front-room
on the first floor&mdash;that with a large bow window&mdash;as
his editorial sanctum, and on busy nights he slept
on the premises instead of returning to Gad&rsquo;s Hill.
Latterly this room was used as an office by the
manager of the Gaiety Theatre. The projection of
the new Kingsway and Aldwych has resulted in the
inevitable evanishment of many Dickensian landmarks,
for a glance at the plans of these thoroughfares
now in course of construction shows that they
will cover an important section of &ldquo;Dickens&rsquo;s
London,&rdquo; such as Clare Market, the New Inn, Portugal
Street, Drury Lane, Sardinia Street, Kingsgate
Street, etc.</p>

associations with Dickens will form a fitting conclusion

<p>In 1838 the author of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; (then lately
completed) was elected a member of the Athen&aelig;um
Club, his sponsor being Mr. Serjeant Storks, and
continued his membership of that very exclusive confraternity
for the rest of his life. The late Rev.
F. G. Waugh, author of a booklet on the Athen&aelig;um
Club, did not think that Dickens considered himself
a popular member, probably because he seldom spoke
to anyone unless previously addressed. When not
taking his sandwich standing, his usual seat in
the coffee-room was the table on the east side of the
room, just south of the fireplace. &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; says
Mr. Waugh, in a letter to the present writer, &ldquo;the
last letter he wrote from here was to his son, who did
not receive it till after his father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; The club,
which preserves the novelist&rsquo;s favourite chair, was
the scene, too, of a happy incident&mdash;the reconciliation
of Thackeray and Dickens after a period of strained
relationship. This occurred only a few days before
the death of the author of &ldquo;Vanity Fair,&rdquo; when the
two great writers, meeting by accident in the lobby
of the club, suddenly turned and saw each other,
&ldquo;and the unrestrained impulse of both was to hold
out the hand of forgiveness and fellowship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;... In the hall, that trysting-place,</p>

</div>
<p>The Temple, practically unchanged since Dickens&rsquo;s
day, ever remained a favourite locality with him.
When quite a young man, and popularly known
as &ldquo;Boz,&rdquo; he entered his name among the students
of the Inn of the Middle Temple, though he did not
eat dinners there until many years later, and was never
called to the Bar. The <i>Daily News</i> offices (the old
building, not the existing ornate structure) in
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
Bouverie Street are remembered chiefly by the fact
that this Liberal newspaper was founded by Dickens,
its first editor, in 1846, and a bust-portrait of him
may be seen in a niche in the fa&ccedil;ade of the new
building. John Forster&rsquo;s residence, No. 58, Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn Fields, is specially memorable on account of the
novelist&rsquo;s associations therewith. Here he was ever
a welcome guest, and here, in 1844, he read &ldquo;The
Chimes&rdquo; from the newly-completed manuscript to an
assembled group of friends, the germ of those public
readings to which he subsequently devoted so much
time and energy. The two houses, Nos. 57 and 58,
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, were once the town mansion of
the Earl of Lindsey. Dickens made Forster&rsquo;s residence
the home of Tulkinghorn, the old family
lawyer in &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; whose room with the
painted ceiling depicting &ldquo;fore-shortened allegory&rdquo;
faces the large forecourt, and is now in the occupation
of a solicitor; the painting, however, was obliterated
some years ago.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN THE WEST COUNTRY.</span></h2>
<p>Dickens first made acquaintance with many provincial
towns during his early newspaper days, when,
as a reporter, he galloped by road in post-chaises, both
by day and night, to remote parts of the country, meeting
with strange adventures, sometimes experiencing
awkward predicaments, from which he invariably
succeeded in extricating himself and in reaching his
destination in good time for publication, his carefully-prepared
notes being transcribed, not infrequently,
during &ldquo;the smallest hours of the night in a swift-flying
carriage and pair,&rdquo; by the light of a blazing
wax-candle. In 1845, when recalling his reporting
days, he informed Forster that he &ldquo;had to charge for
all sorts of breakages fifty times in a journey without
question,&rdquo; as the ordinary results of the pace he was
compelled to travel. He had charged his employers
for everything but a broken head, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; he
na&iuml;vely added, &ldquo;is the only thing they would have
grumbled to pay for.&rdquo; One of the foremost of these
expeditions took place in 1835, when he and a
colleague, Thomas Beard, journeyed by express coach
to Bristol to report, for the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, the
political speeches in connection with Lord John
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Russell&rsquo;s Devon contest. He lodged at the Bush
Inn, where that &ldquo;ill-starred gentleman,&rdquo; Mr. Winkle,
took up his quarters when fleeing from the wrath of
the infuriated Dowler, as set forth in the thirty-eighth
chapter of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo; We are told that Mr.
Winkle found Bristol &ldquo;a shade more dirty than any
place he had ever seen&rdquo;; that, at the time referred
to (nearly eighty years ago), the pavements of that
city were &ldquo;not the widest or cleanest upon earth,&rdquo;
its streets were &ldquo;not altogether the straightest or
least intricate,&rdquo; and their &ldquo;manifold windings and
twistings&rdquo; greatly puzzled Mr. Winkle, who, when
exploring them, lost his way, with the result that
he unexpectedly came upon his old acquaintances,
Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen, the former occupying
a newly-painted tenement (not identified), which
had been recently converted into &ldquo;something between
a shop and a private house,&rdquo; with the word
&ldquo;Surgery&rdquo; inscribed above the window of what had
been the front parlour. At the Bush tavern the
fugitive was discovered by Sam Weller, who had
received peremptory orders from &ldquo;the governor&rdquo; to
follow and keep him in sight until Mr. Pickwick
arrived on the scene. The Bush no longer
exists; it stood in Corn Street, near the Guildhall,
and was taken down in 1864, the present Wiltshire
Bank marking the site. It will be remembered that
it was to Clifton, on the outskirts of Bristol, where
Arabella Allen was sent by her brother (who regarded
himself as &ldquo;her natural protector and guardian&rdquo;) to
spend a few months at an old aunt&rsquo;s, &ldquo;in a nice
dull place,&rdquo; in order to break her to his will that she
should marry Bob Sawyer (&ldquo;late Nockemorf&rdquo;).
Hither Sam Weller went in quest of her, walking (as
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
we are told) &ldquo;up one street and down another&mdash;we
were going to say, up one hill and down another,
only it&rsquo;s all uphill at Clifton&rdquo;&mdash;and, after struggling
across the Downs, &ldquo;against a good high wind,&rdquo;
eventually arrived at &ldquo;several little villas of quiet and
secluded appearance,&rdquo; at one of which he, too, met a
familiar acquaintance in &ldquo;the pretty housemaid from
Mrs. Nupkins&rsquo;s,&rdquo; who proved a valuable guide to the
whereabouts of Miss Allen. In 1866 and 1869
Dickens gave public readings at Clifton, staying
on the former occasion at the Down Hotel. The
suspension bridge across the Avon is the old
Hungerford Bridge, removed in 1863, and the sight
of it at the time of his later visits to Clifton must
have recalled to Dickens the troubled period of his
boyhood at the blacking factory.</p>
<p>The occasion of the Bristol reporting expedition
in 1835 is also memorable for the fact that it marks
the date of Dickens&rsquo;s first visit to the contiguous city
of Bath, which plays a still more important part in
the Transactions of the Pickwick Club. At Bath he
had to prepare a report of a political dinner given
there by Lord John Russell, and to despatch it &ldquo;by
Cooper Company&rsquo;s Coach, leaving the Bush (Bristol)
at half-past six next morning.&rdquo; It was sharp work,
as Russell&rsquo;s speech at the banquet had to be transcribed
by Dickens for the printers while travelling
by the mail-coach vi&acirc; Marlborough for London;
this necessitated for himself and Thomas Beard the
relinquishment of sleep and rest during two consecutive
days and nights. It is fair to suppose that
on one of his early reporting expeditions to the West
of England Dickens put up for a night at the quaint
little roadside inn near Marlborough Downs, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
he so carefully describes in the Bagman&rsquo;s Story in
&ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a strange old place, built of a kind of
shingle, inlaid, as it were, with cross-beams, with
gable-topped windows projecting over the pathway,
and a low door with a dark porch, and a couple of
steep steps leading down into the house, instead of
the modern fashion of half a dozen shallow ones
leading up to it.&rdquo; Like Tom Smart, the hero of the
story, he doubtless slept in the selfsame apartment,
with its &ldquo;big closets, and a bed which might have
served for a whole boarding-school, to say nothing
of a couple of oaken presses that would have held the
baggage of a small army.&rdquo; Nay, he may even have
experienced Tom Smart&rsquo;s strange hallucination in
regard to the ancient armchair, apparently assuming
in the uncertain light of the chamber fire the outlines
of a strangely-formed specimen of humanity, although
probably he did not go so far as to enter into conversation
with this remarkable bedroom companion,
as did the Bagman, whose vivid imagination, aided
by the narcotic effects of his noggins of whisky,
enabled him to impart a spiciness to his narrative.
From the detailed manner in which Dickens portrays
this old-fashioned alehouse, we are justified in conjecturing
that such a place really existed during the
thirties, and attempts have been made to identify it,
for we need not take for granted the statement in
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; that the place had been pulled down.
From inquiries which I instituted on the subject, a
local correspondent informs me that the Marquis of
Ailesbury&rsquo;s Arms at Clatford somewhat answered to
the description prior to extensive structural alterations
effected about twenty years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Another investigator considers that the inn at
Beckhampton, the Catherine Wheel, fulfils most of
the requirements. With this conclusion, however,
the Rev. W. H. Davies, of Avebury, is not disposed
to agree, and the late Rev. A. C. Smith, in his
&ldquo;British and Roman Antiquities,&rdquo; tells us that the
inn which formerly existed at Shepherd&rsquo;s Shord (or
Shore) was the one referred to by Dickens, and that
at the time of the publication of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; everybody
in Wiltshire so identified it. Another suggestion
is that the original of Tom Smart&rsquo;s house of call
was the Kennett Inn at Beckhampton, which, according
to a drawing of the place, answers the
descriptions even better than those already mentioned,
although it stood upon the wrong side of the road.
We ought, I think, to accept the local opinion of
Pickwickian days, and fix the scene of the Bagman&rsquo;s
adventure at Shepherd&rsquo;s Shore.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>Remembering what little leisure he must have had
in the midst of political turmoil and journalistic
responsibilities while at Bath, it is indeed surprising
to find how truthful a presentment of that delightful
city is achieved in &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo; On the occasion in
question he put up at a small hotel, the Saracen&rsquo;s
Head, a quaint-looking, unpretentious building still
existing in Broad Street, its two red-tiled gables and
stuccoed front facing that thoroughfare. The landlady
relates that Dickens, owing to the fact that all
the bedrooms of the house were occupied on his
arrival at a late hour, had to be accommodated with
a room over some stables or outbuildings at the
farther end of the inn yard, overlooking Walcot
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
Street.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> Visitors are shown a curious two-handled
mug which the novelist is believed to have used, and
the bedroom once occupied by him, and containing
the old four-post bedstead upon which he slept;
while in another room, low and raftered, is to be
seen the stiff wooden armchair in which he sat!&mdash;relics
that are deservedly cherished and handed down
as heirlooms.</p>
<p>Bath is frequently referred to in the novelist&rsquo;s
writings, and, judging by a particular allusion to the
historic town, it seems not to have left a very favourable
impression on his mind, for he there mentions it
as &ldquo;that grass-grown city of the ancients.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> At a
subsequent date he remarked: &ldquo;Landor&rsquo;s ghost goes
along the silent streets here before me.... The
place looks to me like a cemetery which the dead have
succeeded in rising and taking. Having built streets
of their old gravestones, they wander about scantly
trying to &lsquo;look alive.&rsquo; A dead failure.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> He had
a pleasant remembrance of Walter Savage Landor at
No. 35, St. James&rsquo;s Square, upon which a tablet was
fixed in 1903 recording the fact of a visit paid to
him by the novelist on the latter&rsquo;s birthday, February
7, 1840, on which occasion he was accompanied
by Mrs. Dickens, Maclise, and Forster, the party
remaining there until the end of the month. We
are assured by his biographer that it was during this
visit to Bath &ldquo;that the fancy which was shortly to
take the form of Little Nell first occurred to its
author.&rdquo; The girl-heroine of &ldquo;The Old Curiosity
Shop&rdquo; was an immense favourite with Landor, who
in after-years emphatically declared that the one
mistake of his life was that he had not purchased the
house in which the conception of her dawned upon
Dickens, and then and there burned it to the ground,
so that no meaner associations should desecrate it.</p>

<p class="pcap">MILE END COTTAGE, ALPHINGTON. (<i><a href="#Page_94">Page 94</a>.</i>)
<br />Taken by Dickens in 1839 for his parents&rsquo; use. &ldquo;The house is on the high road to Plymouth, and the situation is charming&rdquo; (letter to Mr. Thomas Mitton).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Brief as his stay in Bath undoubtedly was in the
capacity of reporter for the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> in 1835,
he, nevertheless, made excellent use of his abnormal
powers of observation in spite of professional activities,
his retentive memory enabling him to reproduce
in &ldquo;The Pickwick Papers&rdquo; a few months afterwards
those typical scenes in the social life of Bath
of that period, which has since undergone many
changes, Mr. Pickwick being almost the last to
witness the peculiarities of Bath society as described
by the novel-writers of a century or so ago. Dickens
noticed, among other topographical features, the
steepness of Park Street, which (he said) &ldquo;was very
much like the perpendicular streets a man sees in a
dream, which he cannot get up for the life of him.&rdquo;
He remembered, too, that the White Hart Hotel
(the proprietor of which establishment was the
Moses Pickwick who owned the very coach on which
Sam Weller saw inscribed &ldquo;the magic name of Pickwick&rdquo;)
stood &ldquo;opposite the great Pump Room,
where the waiters, from their costume, might be mistaken
for Westminster boys, only they destroy the
illusion by behaving themselves so much better.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a>
The White Hart flourished in Stall Street, and until
1864 (when the house was given up) the waiters
wore knee-breeches and silk stockings, and the women
servants donned neat muslin caps. The old coaching
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
inn, alas! no longer exists, and its site is indicated
by the Grand Pump Room Hotel, the original carved
sign of a white hart being preserved and still used
over the door of an inn of the same name in Widcombe,
a suburb of Bath.</p>
<p>The pen-pictures of scenes at the Assembly Rooms
and Pump Rooms are admirably rendered in the
pages of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; and we feel convinced that the
author must have witnessed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bath being full, the company and the sixpences
for tea poured in in shoals. In the ball-room, the
long card-room, the octagonal card-room, the staircases,
and the passages, the hum of many voices
and the sound of many feet were perfectly bewildering.
Dresses rustled, feathers waved, lights
shone, and jewels sparkled. There was the music&mdash;not
of the quadrille band, for it had not yet commenced,
but the music of soft, tiny footsteps, with
now and then a clear, merry laugh, low and gentle,
but very pleasant to hear in a female voice, whether
in Bath or elsewhere. Brilliant eyes, lighted up with
pleasurable expectations, gleamed from every side;
and look where you would, some exquisite form
glided gracefully through the throng, and was no
sooner lost than it was replaced by another as dainty
and bewitching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the tea-room, and hovering round the card-tables,
were a vast number of queer old ladies and
decrepit old gentlemen, discussing all the small-talk
and scandal of the day, with a relish and gusto which
sufficiently bespoke the intensity of the pleasure they
derived from the occupation. Mingled with these
groups were three or four matchmaking mammas,
appearing to be wholly absorbed by the conversation
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
in which they were taking part, but failing not from
time to time to cast an anxious sidelong glance
upon their daughters, who, remembering the maternal
injunction to make the best of their youth, had
already commenced incipient flirtations in the mislaying
of scarves, putting on gloves, setting down
cups, and so forth&mdash;slight matters apparently, but
which may be turned to surprisingly good account
by expert practitioners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lounging near the doors, and in remote corners,
were various knots of silly young men, displaying
various varieties of puppyism and stupidity, amusing
all sensible people near them with their folly and
conceit, and happily thinking themselves the objects
of general admiration&mdash;a wise and merciful dispensation
which no good man will quarrel with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, lastly, seated on some of the back benches,
where they had already taken up their positions for
the evening, were divers unmarried ladies past their
grand climacteric, who, not dancing because there
were no partners for them, and not playing cards
lest they should be set down as irretrievably single,
were in the favourable situation of being able to
abuse everybody without reflecting on themselves.
In short, they could abuse everybody, because everybody
was there. It was a scene of gaiety, glitter,
and show, of richly-dressed people, handsome
mirrors, chalked floors, girandoles, and wax-candles;
and in all parts of the scene, gliding from spot to
spot in silent softness, bowing obsequiously to this
party, nodding familiarly to that, and smiling complacently
on all, was the sprucely-attired person of
Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, Master of the Ceremonies&rdquo;
(chap. xxxv.).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;The great pump-room is a spacious saloon,
ornamented with Corinthian pillars, and a music
gallery, and a Tompion clock, and a statue of Nash,
and a golden inscription, to which all the water-drinkers
should attend, for it appeals to them in the
cause of a deserving charity. There is a large bar
with a marble vase, out of which the pumper gets
the water; and there are a number of yellow-looking
tumblers, out of which the company gets it; and
it is a most edifying and satisfactory sight to behold
the perseverance and gravity with which they swallow
it. There are baths near at hand, in which a part of
the company wash themselves; and a band plays
afterwards to congratulate the remainder on their
having done so. There is another pump-room, into
which infirm ladies and gentlemen are wheeled, in
such an astonishing variety of chairs and chaises that
any adventurous individual who goes in with the
regular number of toes is in imminent danger of
coming out without them; and there is a third, into
which the quiet people go, for it is less noisy than
either. There is an immensity of promenading, on
crutches and off, with sticks and without, and a great
deal of conversation, and liveliness, and pleasantry....
At the afternoon&rsquo;s promenade ... all the
great people, and all the morning water-drinkers,
meet in grand assemblage. After this, they walked
out or drove out, or were pushed out in bath-chairs,
and met one another again. After this, the
gentlemen went to the reading-rooms and met
divisions of the mass. After this, they went home.
If it were theatre night, perhaps they met at the
theatre; if it were assembly night, they met at the
rooms; and if it were neither, they met the next
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
day. A very pleasant routine, with perhaps a slight
tinge of sameness&rdquo; (chap. xxxvi.).</p>
<p>The citizens of Bath are naturally proud of its
Pickwickian associations; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s lodging
in the Royal Crescent is pointed out, as well as the
actual spot in the Assembly Rooms where he played
whist, while the veritable rout seats of that time are
preserved and cherished. The Royal Hotel, whence
Mr. Winkle hurriedly departed by coach for Bristol,
has shared the fate of the White Hart; indeed,
Mr. Snowden Ward avers that there was no Royal
Hotel in Bath in Dickens&rsquo;s time, and that he
probably refers to the York House Hotel, frequently
patronized by royalty, and once at least by the
novelist himself. We may still look, however, upon
the &ldquo;small greengrocer&rsquo;s shop&rdquo; where Bath footmen
used to hold their social evenings, and memorable as
the scene of the &ldquo;leg-o&rsquo;-mutton swarry.&rdquo; It is
now the Beaufort Arms, in a narrow street out of
Queen&rsquo;s Square, Bath, and within a short distance of
No. 12 in the Square, the residence of Angelo Cyrus
Bantam, Esq., Master of the Ceremonies, who welcomed
Mr. Pickwick to Ba-ath.</p>
<p>In the course of an interesting speech delivered in
1865 at the second annual dinner of the Newspaper
Press Fund, Dickens made an interesting allusion to
the Devonshire political contest of thirty years
previously, and to the part he took in it as a
<i>Chronicle</i> reporter. &ldquo;The very last time I was at
Exeter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I strolled into the Castle yard,
there to identify, for the amusement of a friend, the
spot on which I once &lsquo;took,&rsquo; as we used to call it, an
election speech of Lord John Russell ... in the midst
of a lively fight maintained by all the vagabonds in that
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
division of the county, and under such a pelting rain
that I remember two good-natured colleagues, who
chanced to be at leisure, held a pocket-handkerchief
over my note-book, after the manner of a state
canopy in an ecclesiastical procession.&rdquo; In 1839
a mission of a very different character caused him to
journey to &ldquo;the capital of the West&rdquo; (as that city has
been denominated), his object being to arrange a new
home for his parents in that locality. Making his
headquarters at the New London Inn (where he had
Charles Kean&rsquo;s sitting-room), he soon discovered
a suitable residence about a mile south from the city
boundary on the highroad to Plymouth, Mile End
Cottage, which is really divided into two portions,
one-half being then occupied by the landlady, and the
other being available for the new tenants. Dickens,
when writing to Forster, described the place as &ldquo;two
white cottages,&rdquo; and respecting the accommodation
here provided for his parents, he said: &ldquo;I almost
forget the number of rooms, but there is an excellent
parlour, which I am furnishing as a drawing-room,
and there is a splendid garden.&rdquo; In a letter to his
friend Thomas Mitton he dilates more fully upon the
attractions of the cottage and its environment. &ldquo;I
do assure you,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that I am charmed
with the place and the beauty of the country round
about, though I have not seen it under very favourable
circumstances.... It is really delightful, and when
the house is to rights and the furniture all in, I shall
be quite sorry to leave it.... The situation is
charming; meadows in front, an orchard running
parallel to the garden hedge, richly-wooded hills
closing in the prospect behind, and, away to the left,
before a splendid view of the hill on which Exeter is
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
situated, the cathedral towers rising up into the sky
in the most picturesque manner possible. I don&rsquo;t
think I ever saw so cheerful and pleasant a spot....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a>
It will be remembered that &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo;
opens with a reference to &ldquo;a sequestered part of the
county of Devonshire&rdquo; (<i>sic</i>), where lived one Mr.
Godfrey Nickleby, the grandfather of the hero of the
story; and there is no doubt that the home of
Mrs. Nickleby&rsquo;s friends, the Dibabses, as pictured by
that lady in the fifty-fifth chapter, was identical with
the tenement in which Mr. and Mrs. John Dickens
found a temporary lodgment&mdash;&ldquo;the beautiful little
thatched white house one story high, covered all
over with ivy and creeping plants, with an exquisite
little porch with twining honeysuckle, and all sorts of
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Dickens&rsquo;s return to England at the end of
his triumphant progress through the United States in
1842 was the occasion for a special celebration, which
assumed the form of a holiday trip in Cornwall with
his cherished friends Stanfield, Maclise, and Forster.
They chose Cornwall for the excursion because
it transpired that this &ldquo;desolate region,&rdquo; as Dickens
termed it, was unfamiliar to them, and would therefore
enhance their enjoyment. The decision to
make Cornwall their destination suggested to Dickens
the idea of opening his new book, &ldquo;Martin
Chuzzlewit,&rdquo; on that rugged coast, &ldquo;in some terrible
dreary, iron-bound spot,&rdquo; and to select the lantern of
a lighthouse (probably the Longship&rsquo;s, off Land&rsquo;s
End) as the opening scene; but he changed his mind.
This expedition in the late summer lasted nearly
three weeks, it proving a source of such unexpected
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
and unabated attraction that the merry party felt
loath to return to town. Railways were not of much
use to them, as they did not penetrate to the remote
districts which the travellers desired to visit. Post-horses
were therefore requisitioned, and when the
roads proved inaccessible to these, pedestrianism was
perforce resorted to. They visited Tintagel, and
explored every part of mountain and sea &ldquo;consecrated
by the legends of Arthur.&rdquo; They ascended to the
cradle of the highest pinnacle of Mount St. Michael,<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a>
and descended in several mines; but above all the
marvels of land and sea, that which yielded the most
lasting impression was a sunset at Land&rsquo;s End,
concerning which Forster says: &ldquo;There was something
in the sinking of the sun behind the Atlantic
that autumn afternoon, as we viewed it together from
the top of the rock projecting farthest into the sea,
which each in his turn declared to have no parallel
in memory.&rdquo; The famous Logan Stone, too, was
not forgotten. Writing subsequently to Forster, the
novelist said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I still see the Logan Stone,
and you perched on the giddy top, while we, rocking
it on its pivot, shrank from all that lay concealed
below!&rdquo; For Forster possessed the necessary courage
and agility (lacking in the rest) to mount the huge
swaying stone, the feat being immortalized by Stanfield
in a sketch bequeathed to the Victoria and
Albert Museum.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a> Lastly, the waterfall at St.
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
Wighton was visited, memorable for the fact that
a painting of it (from a sketch made on this occasion)
appears as the background to Maclise&rsquo;s picture of &ldquo;A
Girl at a Waterfall,&rdquo; the figure being depicted from
a sister-in-law of Dickens. The novelist, while the
glow of enjoyment was yet upon him, could not resist
dilating upon the exhilarating effect induced by this
glorious holiday in the midst of natural scenery, then
witnessed by the joyous quartette for the first time;
and the following letter, addressed to his American
friend, Professor Felton, fittingly concludes these
references to the event which he ever recalled with
delight: &ldquo;Blessed star of the morning, such a trip
as we had into Cornwall, just after Longfellow went
away!... We went down into Devonshire by the
railroad, and there we hired an open carriage from an
innkeeper, patriotic in all Pickwick matters, and went
on with post-horses. Sometimes we travelled all night,
sometimes all day, sometimes both. I kept the joint-stock
purse, ordered all the dinners, paid all the turnpikes,
conducted facetious conversations with the post-boys,
and regulated the pace at which we travelled.
Stanfield (an old sailor) consulted an enormous map
on all disputed points of wayfaring, and referred,
moreover, to a pocket-compass and other scientific
instruments. The luggage was in Forster&rsquo;s department,
and Maclise, having nothing particular to do,
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
sang songs. Heavens! if you could have seen the
necks of bottles&mdash;distracting in their immense
varieties of shape&mdash;peering out of the carriage
pockets! If you could have witnessed the deep
devotion of the post-boys, the wild attachment of the
hostlers, the maniac glee of the waiters! If you
could have followed us into the earthy old churches
we visited, and into the strange caverns on the
gloomy seashore, and down into the depths of
mines, and up to the tops of giddy heights, where
the unspeakably green water was roaring I don&rsquo;t
know how many hundred feet below! If you could
have seen but one gleam of the bright fires by which
we sat in the big rooms of ancient inns at night until
long after the small hours had come and gone, or
smelt but one steam of the hot punch,... which
came in every evening in a huge, broad, china bowl!
I never laughed in my life as I did on this journey.
It would have done you good to hear me. I was
choking and gasping and bursting the buckle off the
back of my stock all the way, and Stanfield ... got
into such apoplectic entanglements that we were often
obliged to beat him on the back with portmanteaus
before we could recover him. Seriously, I do believe
that there never was such a trip. And they made
such sketches, those two men, in the most romantic
of our halting-places, that you could have sworn we
had the Spirit of Beauty with us, as well as the Spirit
of Fun....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">THE GEORGE INN, AMESBURY. (<i><a href="#Page_100">Page 100</a>.</i>)
<br />&ldquo;The Blue Dragon&rdquo; of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Dickens, as already intimated, originally conceived
the idea of opening the tale of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rdquo;
on the coast of Cornwall. Instead of this, however,
we find, in the initial chapter of that story, that the
scene is laid in a village near Salisbury. That he
had previously made himself acquainted with Wiltshire
is indicated in his correspondence with Forster
in 1842, where he declared (for instance) that in
beholding an American prairie for the first time he
felt no such emotions as he experienced when crossing
Salisbury Plain. &ldquo;I would say to every man who
can&rsquo;t see a prairie,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;go to Salisbury
Plain, Marlborough Downs, or any of the broad,
high, open lands near the sea. Many of them are
fully as impressive, and Salisbury Plain is <i>decidedly</i>
more so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six years later he and Forster, with John Leech
and Mark Lemon, procured horses at Salisbury, and
&ldquo;passed the whole of a March day in riding over
every part of the plain, visiting Stonehenge, and
exploring Hazlitt&rsquo;s hut at Winterslow, the birthplace
of some of his finest essays.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>There are persons still living in the neighbourhood
of Salisbury who remember Dickens&rsquo;s quest for
local colour with which to give a semblance of reality
to his topographical descriptions in &ldquo;Chuzzlewit.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The fair old town of Salisbury&rdquo; figures prominently
in that story, and we must believe that his
allusion (in the fifth chapter) to the grand cathedral
derived inspiration from personal observation: &ldquo;The
yellow light that streamed in through the ancient
windows in the choir was mingled with a murky
red. As the grand tones (of the organ) resounded
through the church, they seemed to Tom to find
an echo in the depth of every ancient tomb, no less
than in the deep mystery of his own heart.&rdquo; He
makes a curious mistake in the twelfth chapter when
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
speaking of the &ldquo;towers&rdquo; of the old cathedral; but,
of course, he knew perfectly well that the venerable
fane is surmounted by a beautifully tapering spire,
immortalized in one of Constable&rsquo;s most remarkable
pictures. The scene in Salisbury Market, so vividly
portrayed in chapter v., could not have been penned
except by an acute observer like Dickens; nothing
escaped him, and he noted all the details of that busy
scene, and stored them in his retentive memory in
readiness for the pen-picture which he afterwards
delineated so faithfully and so picturesquely.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;little Wiltshire village,&rdquo; described as being
within an easy journey of Salisbury, has not been
absolutely identified. Certain commentators opine
that Amesbury is intended, while others consider it
more probable that the novelist had in his mind the
village of Alderbury, and that its principal inn, the
Green Dragon, was the original of Mrs. Lupin&rsquo;s
establishment, concerning which that unprincipled
adventurer, Montague Tigg, spoke with undisguised
disparagement and contempt.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND.</span></h2>
<p>Portsmouth is justly proud of the fact that it is
the native place of certain distinguished men&mdash;to
wit, Charles Dickens, Sir Walter Besant, and Brunel
the great engineer.</p>
<p>In 1838, when engaged upon &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo;
Dickens renewed acquaintance with the town, of
which it is fair to suppose he could remember but
little, seeing that he was only about two years of age
when his father was recalled to London, taking with
him wife and family. He, however, astonished
Forster (who accompanied him thither) by readily
recalling memories of his childhood there, and distinctly
remembering such details as the exact shape
of the military parade.</p>
<p>Dickens&rsquo;s particular object in then journeying to
Portsmouth (not on foot, as did Nicholas and
Smike) was doubtless for the express purpose of
obtaining local colour for &ldquo;Nickleby,&rdquo; as presented
in chapters xxiii. and xxiv. He succeeded in
finding suitable lodging for Vincent Crummles at
Bulph the pilot&rsquo;s in St. Thomas&rsquo;s Street (conjectured
to be No. 78), for Miss Snevellicci at a tailor&rsquo;s in
Lombard Street, while Nickleby and his companion
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
were quartered at a tobacconist&rsquo;s on the Common
Hard, which he describes as &ldquo;a dirty street leading
down to the dockyard.&rdquo; The old Portsmouth
Theatre, the scene of Nicholas&rsquo;s early triumphs on
the stage, plays a prominent part in the tale. This
primitive building, which stood in the High Street,
was destroyed many years ago; it occupied the site
of the Cambridge Barracks; the present house is
styled &ldquo;The New Theatre Royal.&rdquo; The story is
current in Portsmouth that Dickens, on the occasion
just referred to, called upon the manager at the old
theatre and actually asked for a small part. Whether
this tradition be true or false, we are justified in
assuming that he and Forster went behind the scenes
and chatted with the players, the result being the portrayal
of those inimitable descriptions which treat of
the company of Mr. Vincent Crummles, and of the
&ldquo;great bespeak&rdquo; for Miss Snevellicci. Apropos of
the theatre itself, as it appeared to the hero of the
story, we read: &ldquo;It was not very light, but Nicholas
found himself close to the first entrance on the
prompter&rsquo;s side, among bare walls, dusty scenes,
mildewed clouds, heavily daubed draperies, and dirty
floors. He looked about him; ceiling, pit, boxes,
gallery, orchestra, fittings, and decorations of every
kind&mdash;all looked coarse, cold, gloomy, and wretched.
&lsquo;Is this a theatre?&rsquo; whispered Smike in amazement.
&lsquo;I thought it was a blaze of light and finery.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why,
so it is,&rsquo; replied Nicholas, hardly less surprised;
&lsquo;but not by day, Smike&mdash;not by day!&rsquo;&rdquo; Matters
theatrical have improved vastly since then, and provincial
theatres now vie with those in the Metropolis
in regard to the comfort and magnificence of their
appointments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Plymouth, in a much less degree, is also associated
with Dickens. There are slight references to the town
in &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bleak House.&rdquo; He
visited Plymouth in 1858 and in 1861, staying at
the West Hoe Hotel on the first occasion, when he
gave public readings in a handsome room at Stonehouse,
&ldquo;on the top of a windy and muddy hill,
leading (literally) to nowhere; and it looks (except
that it is new and <i>mortary</i>) as if the subsidence of the
waters after the Deluge might have left it where it
is.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> In 1861 we find Plymouth again included in
the itinerary of an Autumn Reading tour. Dickens&rsquo;s
connection with Brighton was of a more intimate
character, his acquaintance with &ldquo;the Queen of
watering-places&rdquo; beginning as early as 1837, when
he resumed the writing of &ldquo;Oliver Twist.&rdquo; &ldquo;We
have a beautiful bay-windowed sitting-room here,
fronting the sea,&rdquo; he informed Forster; &ldquo;but I have
seen nothing of B.&rsquo;s brother who was to have shown
me the lions, and my notions of the place are consequently
somewhat confined, being limited to the
pavilion, the chain pier, and the sea. The last is
quite enough for me....&rdquo; During his stay he
attended a performance at the theatre of a comedy
entitled &ldquo;No Thoroughfare,&rdquo; this being, curiously
enough, the exact title of the only story he ever
took part himself in dramatizing three years before
his death. In 1841 he again journeyed by coach,
the Brighton Era, to Brighton, and busied himself
there with &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; making his temporary
home at the Old Ship Hotel at No. 38, King&rsquo;s
Road&mdash;not the more modern establishment of that
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
name in Ship Street.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> In May, 1847, Dickens
lodged for some weeks at No. 148, King&rsquo;s Road,
for the recovery of his wife&rsquo;s health after the birth
of a son, christened Sydney Smith Haldemand. He
went there first with Mrs. Dickens and her sister
and the eldest boy (the latter just recovered from an
attack of scarlet fever), and was joined at the latter
part of the time by his two little daughters. In the
spring of 1850 he was again at the King&rsquo;s Road
lodgings, his thoughts being then concentrated upon
the new weekly journal, <i>Household Words</i>, the first
number of which appeared in March of that year.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In March, 1848, Dickens and his wife, accompanied
by Mrs. Macready, spent three weeks in
Brighton at Junction House, where they were &ldquo;very
comfortably (not to say gorgeously) accommodated&rdquo;;
and for a short time during the spring of 1853,
when engaged upon &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; he rented
rooms at No. 1, Junction Parade. Of all his
Brighton residences, however, that which justly
claims priority is the celebrated Bedford Hotel,
whence (in November, 1848) we find letters addressed
to his friends Frank Stone, A.R.A. (who was then
designing illustrations for &ldquo;The Haunted Man&rdquo;)
and Mark Lemon. To the artist he said: &ldquo;The
Duke of Cambridge is staying at this house, and
they are driving me mad by having Life Guards
bands under our windows playing <i>our</i> overtures (<i>i.e.</i>,
the overtures in connection with the amateur performances
by Dickens and his friends)!... I
don&rsquo;t in the abstract approve of Brighton. I couldn&rsquo;t
pass an autumn here, but it is a gay place for a week
or so; and when one laughs or cries, and suffers
the agitation that some men experience over their
books, it&rsquo;s a bright change to look out of window,
and see the gilt little toys on horseback going up
and down before the mighty sea, and thinking
nothing of it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> In February, 1849, Dickens spent
another holiday at Brighton, accompanied by his
wife and sister-in-law and two daughters, and they
were joined by the genial artist John Leech and his
wife. They had not been in their lodgings a week
when both his landlord and his landlord&rsquo;s daughter
went raving mad, this untoward circumstance compelling
the lodgers to seek quarters elsewhere&mdash;at
the Bedford Hotel. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; wrote Dickens, when
relating the adventure to Forster, &ldquo;you could have
heard the cursing and crying of the two; could
have seen the physician and nurse quoited out into
the passage by the madman at the hazard of their
lives; could have seen Leech and me flying to the
doctor&rsquo;s rescue; could have seen our wives pulling
us back; could have seen the M.D. faint with fear;
could have seen three other M.D.&rsquo;s come to his aid;
with an atmosphere of Mrs. Gamps, strait-waistcoats,
struggling friends and servants, surrounding
the whole, you would have said it was quite worthy
of me, and quite in keeping with my usual proceedings.&rdquo;
The Reading tour in 1861 again took
him to Brighton and the Bedford, and one of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
audiences included the Duchess of Cambridge and a
Princess. &ldquo;I think they were pleased with me, and
I am sure I was with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apart from these personal associations, Brighton
derives particular interest from the fact that it figures
largely in &ldquo;Dombey and Son.&rdquo; It was at the
Bedford where Mr. Dombey stayed during his weekend
visits to Brighton for the purpose of seeing
his children, and where Major Bagstock enjoyed the
privilege of dining with that purse-proud City
merchant. It was to Brighton that Little Paul
was sent to school, first as a pupil of the austere and
vinegary Mrs. Pipchin. &ldquo;The castle of this ogress
and child-queller was in a steep by-street at
Brighton, where the soil was more than usually
chalky, flinty, and sterile, and the houses were more
than usually brittle and thin; where the small front-gardens
had an unaccountable property of producing
nothing but marigolds, whatever was sown in them;
and where snails were constantly discovered holding
on to the street doors, and other public places they
were not expected to ornament, with the tenacity
of cupping-glasses.&rdquo; Here also was the superior
and &ldquo;very expensive&rdquo; establishment of Dr. Blimber&mdash;&ldquo;a
great hot-house, in which there was a forcing
apparatus incessantly at work,&rdquo; where, we are told,
&ldquo;mental green peas were produced at Christmas,
and intellectual asparagus all the year round.
Mathematical gooseberries (very sour ones, too)
were common at untimely seasons, and from mere
sprouts of bushes, under Dr. Blimber&rsquo;s cultivation.
Every description of Greek and Latin vegetable was
got off the driest twigs of boys under the frostiest
circumstances.&rdquo; We learn on excellent authority
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
that Dr. Blimber and his school really existed at
Brighton, the prototype of the worthy pedagogue
being Dr. Everard, whose celebrated seminary was
familiarly called the &ldquo;Young House of Lords,&rdquo; from
the aristocracy of the pupils. It seems that during
the Christmas holidays it became customary with
Dr. Everard to organize dances for the boys (such
as that so delightfully described in the fourteenth
chapter of &ldquo;Dombey and Son&rdquo;). In those days,
curly locks were considered an indispensable accessory
to full dress, and the whole of the afternoon preceding
the ball Dr. Everard&rsquo;s house was pervaded by
a strong smell of singed hair and curling-tongs.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a>
&ldquo;There was such ... a smell of singed hair that
Dr. Blimber sent up the footman with his compliments,
and wished to know if the house was on
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the summer and autumn of 1849 Dickens went
with his family, for the first time, to Bonchurch,
Isle of Wight, where he hired for six months the
attractive villa, Winterbourne, belonging to the
Rev. James White (an author of some repute and
a keen lover of books), with whom his intimacy,
already begun, now ripened into a lifelong friendship.
The novelist had in June of that year passed
a brief period at Shanklin, whence he wrote to his
wife: &ldquo;I have taken a most delightful and beautiful
house, belonging to White, at Bonchurch&mdash;cool,
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
airy, private bathing; everything delicious. I think
it is the prettiest place I ever saw in my life at home
or abroad.... A waterfall in the grounds, which
I have arranged with a carpenter to convert into a
perpetual shower-bath.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></p>
<p>He liked the place exceedingly at first, and considered
that the views from the summit of the
highest downs &ldquo;are only to be equalled on the
Genoese shore of the Mediterranean.&rdquo; The variety
of walks in the neighbourhood struck him as extraordinary;
the people were civil, and everything was
cheap, while he fully appreciated the fact that the
place was certainly cold rather than hot in the summertime,
and the sea-bathing proved &ldquo;delicious.&rdquo; Here
at Bonchurch he was joined by John Leech, and
soon settled down to work, being then engaged upon
the early portion of &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; varying
his literary occupations by taking part, with his
customary zest, in dinners at Blackgang and picnics
of &ldquo;tremendous success&rdquo; on Shanklin Down. One
of these festivities he particularly remembered, when
he expressly stipulated that the party should be provided
with materials for a fire and a great iron pot
to boil potatoes in, these, with the comestibles, being
conveyed to the ground in a cart. Doubtless this
was the veritable function described by the late
Mrs. Ph&oelig;be Lankester (&ldquo;Penelope&rdquo;). Her husband,
Dr. Lankester (to whom Dickens referred as &ldquo;a
very good, merry fellow&rdquo;), and other distinguished
men of science then staying at Sandown, belonged to
a select and notable club founded originally by the
younger members of the British Association, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
called the &ldquo;Red Lions.&rdquo; The Bonchurch party,
headed by Dickens, constituted themselves into a
temporary rival club, called the &ldquo;Sea Serpents,&rdquo; and
picnics were arranged between the two factions, the
meetings usually taking place at Cook&rsquo;s Castle.
&ldquo;Well do I recollect,&rdquo; observes Mrs. Lankester,
&ldquo;the jolly procession from Sandown as it moved
across the Downs, young and old carrying aloft a
banner bearing the device of a noble red lion painted
in vermilion on a white ground. Wending up the
hill from the Bonchurch side might be seen the
&lsquo;Sea Serpents,&rsquo; with their ensign floating in the
wind&mdash;a waving, curling serpent, cut out of yards
and yards of calico, and painted of a bronzy-green
colour with fiery red eyes, its tail being supported
at the end by a second banner-holder. Carts brought
up the provisions on either side, and at the top the
factions met to prepare and consume the banquet on
the short, sweet grass under shadow of a rock or a
tree. Charles Dickens delighted in the fun. He
usually boiled the potatoes when the fire had been
lighted by the youngsters, and handed them round
in a saucepan, and John Leech used to make
sketches of us, one of which is still to be seen in the
collection from <i>Punch</i>, and is called &lsquo;Awful Appearance
of a &ldquo;Wopps&rdquo; at a Picnic.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> I was very young
then, and did not fully realize what it was to eat
potatoes boiled by Charles Dickens, or to make a figure
in a sketch by Leech.&rdquo; On one of these jovial occasions
a race was run, after the repast, between Mark
Lemon and Dr. Lankester, both competitors of
abnormal stoutness, Macready officiating as judge,
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
after which the merry party adjourned to Dickens&rsquo;s
villa for tea and music.</p>
<p>His stay at Bonchurch was enlivened, too, by
visits from such cherished friends as Justice Talfourd,
Frank Stone, and Augustus Egg, social intercourse
with whom formed agreeable interludes between
severe spells of literary work. Unhappily, the
enervating effect of the climate presently began to
prostrate him, and after a few weeks&rsquo; residence he
complained of insomnia, extreme mental depression,
and a &ldquo;dull, stupid languor.&rdquo; Commenting upon
his physical condition, he remarked: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mortal
mistake&mdash;that&rsquo;s the plain fact. Of all the places I
ever have been in, I have never been in one so
difficult to exist in pleasantly. Naples is hot and
dirty, New York feverish, Washington bilious,
Genoa exciting, Paris rainy; but Bonchurch&mdash;smashing.
I am quite convinced that I should die here in
a year.&rdquo; His wife, sister-in-law, and the Leeches
were also affected, but not to the same extent,
and, finding it impossible to endure much longer
the distressing symptoms, he determined to leave
Bonchurch at the end of September and &ldquo;go down
to some cold place,&rdquo; such as Ramsgate, for a week
or two, hoping thus to shake off the effects. In
the interval he completed the fifth number of
&ldquo;Copperfield,&rdquo; after which, during the remainder
of the holiday, he and his party (by way of relaxation)
indulged in such amusements as &ldquo;great games
of rounders every afternoon, with all Bonchurch
looking on.&rdquo; These revels were disagreeably interrupted
by a serious accident to John Leech, who,
while bathing in a rough sea, was knocked over by
an immense wave, which resulted in congestion of
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
the brain, and necessitated, first, the placing of
&ldquo;twenty of his namesakes on his temple,&rdquo; and then,
as the illness developed, the continuous application
of ice to the head, with blood-letting from the arm.
The unfortunate artist becoming gradually worse,
Dickens essayed the effect of mesmerism, in the
virtue of which he apparently had faith, and succeeded
in obtaining a period of much-needed sleep for the
relief of the invalid, whose condition thenceforth
improved until complete restoration of his customary
health became assured, enabling him for many subsequent
years to delight the world with his inimitable
pencil. As already intimated, Dickens remained in
the Island until the expiration of the time originally
planned for this seaside holiday; but although he
brought away many happy associations, he never
renewed acquaintance with Bonchurch.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN EAST ANGLIA.</span></h2>
<p>Dickens must have become first acquainted with
Eastern England during his reporting days, as many
of the scenes in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; are laid in the chief
town of Suffolk. The merging, in 1899, of the
<i>Suffolk Chronicle</i> into the <i>Suffolk Times and Mercury</i>
revived an incident in Dickens&rsquo;s career as a reporter,
in stating that it was the <i>Suffolk Chronicle</i> which, in
1835, brought him down to Ipswich for the purpose
of assisting in reporting the speeches in connection
with the Parliamentary election at that time being
contested in the county. We are further assured by
the same authority that &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; (then actually engaged
upon the opening chapters of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;)
stayed at the Great White Horse in Tavern Street
for two or three weeks, and it has been reasonably
surmised that the night adventure with &ldquo;the middle-aged
lady in the yellow curl-papers,&rdquo; ascribed to
Mr. Pickwick, was a veritable experience of the
young author himself. It is said that, in consequence
of this embarrassing mischance, Dickens entertained
a feeling of prejudice against the house, and never
liked the place afterwards. If this be correct, it
accounts for the somewhat disparaging remarks in
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; concerning the hotel: &ldquo;Never were
such labyrinths of uncarpeted passages, such clusters
of mouldy, badly-lighted rooms, such huge numbers
of small dens for eating or sleeping in, beneath any
one roof, as are collected together between the four
walls of the Great White Horse at Ipswich.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
the famous hostelry still flourishes, and makes
the most of its Pickwickian associations, even to
the extent of revealing to visitors the identical bedroom
(No. 16), where the adventure occurred.
Over the principal hotel entrance we may yet see the
stone presentment of a &ldquo;rampacious&rdquo; white horse,
&ldquo;distantly resembling an insane cart-horse&rdquo;; but
the building generally has since been altered in the
direction of certain improvements necessitated by the
requirements of present-day travellers.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">THE COMMON HARD, PORTSMOUTH. (<i><a href="#Page_102">Page 102</a>.</i>)
<br />Nickleby and Snipe lodged &ldquo;at a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop on the Common Hard,&rdquo; now known as &ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>We can readily conceive that the description of
the coach journey to Ipswich, starting from the Bull
Inn, Whitechapel, and rattling along the Whitechapel
and Mile End Roads, &ldquo;to the admiration of
the whole population of that pretty densely-populated
quarter,&rdquo; and so to Suffolk&rsquo;s county town (as duly
set forth in the twenty-second chapter of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;),
is a personal reminiscence of Dickens himself
when fulfilling his engagement with the <i>Suffolk
Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>While busy with newspaper responsibilities, to
which he had pledged himself, he evidently made
the best use of the opportunities thus afforded of
noting certain topographical details of the town,
finding &ldquo;in a kind of courtyard of venerable appearance,&rdquo;
near St. Clement&rsquo;s Church, a suitable locale
for the incident of the unexpected meeting of Sam
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
Weller and Job Trotter; the &ldquo;green gate,&rdquo; which
Job was seen to open and close after him, is locally
believed to be one that adjoins the churchyard a few
yards from Church Street, the inhabitants taking
great pride in pointing it out as the precise spot
where Alfred Jingle&rsquo;s body-servant embraced Sam
&ldquo;in an ecstasy of joy.&rdquo; In regard to these scenes
Ipswich is mentioned by name, but it has been conjectured
that the town also figures in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;
under the successful disguise of &ldquo;Eatanswill,&rdquo; although
Norwich has been mentioned in this connection.
Certainly the weight of such evidence as that proffered
by the <i>Suffolk Times and Mercury</i> favours the
belief that Ipswich stood for the unflattering portrait,
and, but for the facts as averred by that journal, we
should possibly never have had Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
nocturnal misadventure, nor heard of the rival editors
of the <i>Eatanswill Gazette</i> and the <i>Eatanswill Independent</i>.</p>
<p>Dickens&rsquo;s reporting expedition in Suffolk during
the electoral campaign of 1835 doubtless compelled
him to include in his itinerary several of the leading
towns in the county, where political meetings would
naturally be held, and among them Bury St. Edmunds,
where, according to tradition, he put up at
the Angel Inn, his room being No. 11. In describing
this hostelry, Mr. Percy Fitzgerald says that it is &ldquo;a
solemn, rather imposing, and stately building, of a
gloomy slate colour, and of the nature of a family
hotel.... It has yards and stabling behind it,
which must have flourished in the old posting times.&rdquo;
Standing in Market Square, it continues to this day
to be the principal hotel in the place, and remains in
much the same condition as when the novelist knew
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
it about seventy years ago. Bury St. Edmunds, like
Ipswich, has won immortality in the pages of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo;
where it is referred to as &ldquo;a handsome little
town of thriving and cleanly appearance,&rdquo; its well-paved
streets being specially commended. In one of
&ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller&rdquo; papers he calls it
&ldquo;a bright little town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are told that the coach, with Mr. Pickwick
among the passengers newly arrived from Eatanswill,
pulled up at the &ldquo;large inn, situated in a wide, open
street, nearly facing the old abbey.&rdquo; &ldquo;And this,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;is the Angel. We alight here,
Sam...;&rdquo; whereupon a private room was ordered,
and then dinner, everything being arranged with
caution, for it will be remembered that Mr. Pickwick
and his faithful attendant were in quest of that
thorough-paced adventurer Alfred Jingle, Esq., &ldquo;of
No Hall, Nowhere,&rdquo; intent upon frustrating probable
intentions on his part of practising further
deceptions. Here, at Bury, the &ldquo;Mulberry man&rdquo;
(otherwise Job Trotter) was found by Sam in the
pious act of reading a hymn-book, a discovery which
proved to be the initial stage of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
adventure at the boarding-school for young ladies&mdash;Westgate
House&mdash;which, we are told, is a well-known
residence called Southgate House, although
there are other antique-looking schools for girls on
the Westgate side of the town that seem more or
less to answer the description.</p>
<p>More than two decades later&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, in 1861&mdash;Dickens
again visited both Ipswich and Bury St.
Edmunds, when he gave readings from his works,
beginning the series at Norwich, where, writing from
the recently-demolished Royal Hotel in the Market
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
Place, he spoke of his audience in that city as &ldquo;a
very lumpish audience indeed ... an intent and
staring audience. They laughed, though, very well,
and the storm made them shake themselves again.
But they were not magnetic, and the great big place
(St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall) was out of sorts somehow.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a></p>
<p>On the last day of the year 1848, Dickens contemplated
an excursion with Leech, Lemon, and
Forster to some old cathedral city then unfamiliar
to him, believing the sight of &ldquo;pastures new&rdquo; would
afford him the necessary mental refreshment. &ldquo;What
do you say to Norwich and Stanfield Hall?&rdquo; he
queried of Forster, and it was decided forthwith that
the three friends should depart thence. Stanfield
Hall had just gained unenviable notoriety as the
scene of a dreadful tragedy&mdash;the murder of Jeremy,
the Recorder of Norwich, by Rush, afterwards
executed at Norwich Castle. They arrived between
the Hall and Potass Farm as the search was going
on for the pistol, and the novelist was fain to confess
that the place had nothing attractive about it, unless
such a definition might be applied to a &ldquo;murderous
look that seemed to invite such a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quaint old Norwich, as it has been justly termed
(although its quaintness and picturesqueness have
suffered woefully in recent years through commercial
innovations), did not appeal to Dickens, who declared
it to be &ldquo;a disappointment&rdquo;&mdash;everything
there save the ancient castle, &ldquo;which we found fit
for a gigantic scoundrel&rsquo;s exit,&rdquo; alluding, of course,
to Rush. The castle no longer serves as the county
prison, and its gruesome associations are practically
obliterated by the wholesome use to which the
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
massive Norman structure is devoted, that of museum
and art gallery under civic control.</p>
<p>Without doubt Dickens&rsquo;s principal motive in
journeying to Norfolk and Suffolk in 1848 was to
obtain &ldquo;local colour&rdquo; for &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; the
writing of which he was then meditating. He
stayed for a time at Somerleyton Hall, near Lowestoft,
as the guest of Sir Morton Peto, the well-known
civil engineer and railway contractor, under whose
guidance he first made acquaintance with that portion
of Suffolk, studying it carefully, and afterwards portraying
it in the story with characteristic exactitude.
Two miles from Somerleyton Hall (now the residence
of Sir Saville Crossley, M.P.) is Blundeston,
a typical English village, which, thinly disguised as
Blunderstone, appears in the book as the birthplace
of David. The novelist afterwards confessed that
he noticed the name on a direction-post between
Lowestoft and Yarmouth, and at once adapted it
because he liked the sound of the word; the actual
direction-post still standing as he saw it.</p>
<p>There is a little uncertainty respecting the identity
of the &ldquo;Rookery&rdquo; where David first saw the light,
the Rectory being regarded by some careful students
of the topography of &ldquo;Copperfield&rdquo; as the possible
original, whence can be obtained a fairly distinct view
of the church porch and the gravestones in the churchyard.
Local tradition, however, favours Blundeston
Hall, the present tenant-owner of which (Mr. T.
Hardwich Woods) remembers that when very young
he was taken by the old housekeeper down the
&ldquo;long passage ... leading from Peggotty&rsquo;s kitchen
to the front entrance,&rdquo; and shown the &ldquo;dark storeroom&rdquo;
opening out of it. While staying in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
neighbourhood Dickens visited Blundeston Hall,
which presented a weird and gloomy appearance
before its recent restoration, and the fact is recalled
that for a brief space he contemplated the prospect
from one of the side windows facing the church,
then plainly visible from this point, but the view is
now obstructed by trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In no other residence hereabouts,&rdquo; observes
Mr. Woods, &ldquo;do rooms and passages coincide so
exactly with the descriptions given in the novel.&rdquo;
In the garden we may still behold the &ldquo;tall old
elm-trees&rdquo; in which there were formerly some rooks&rsquo;
nests, but no rooks. (&ldquo;David Copperfield all over!&rdquo;
cried Miss Betsey. &ldquo;David Copperfield from head
to foot! Calls a house a rookery when there&rsquo;s not a
rook near it, and takes the birds on trust because he
sees the nests!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The roadside tavern referred to in the fourth
chapter as &ldquo;our little village alehouse&rdquo; may be
recognised in the Plough at Blundeston, to the
recently-stuccoed front of which are affixed the
initials &ldquo;R. E. B.&rdquo; and the date &ldquo;1701&rdquo; in wrought-iron.</p>
<p>Blundeston Church, like many others in East
Anglia, has a round tower (probably Norman), but
no spire, as mentioned in the story; the high-backed
pews and quaint pulpit have since been replaced by
others of modern workmanship, but happily the
ancient rood-screen with its painted panels has
survived such sacrilegious treatment. The porch,
with a sun-dial above the entrance, is still intact.
&ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; says little David, &ldquo;half so
green that I know anywhere as the grass of that
churchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees;
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
nothing half so quiet as its tombstones. The sheep
are feeding there when I kneel up, early in the
morning, in my little bed in a closet within my
mother&rsquo;s room to look out at it; and I see the red
light shining on the sun-dial, and I think within
myself, &lsquo;Is the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that it can
tell the time again?&rsquo;&rdquo; It is interesting to know
that it was at Blundeston House (now called The
Lodge) where the poet Gray stayed with his friend
the Rev. Norton Nicholls (rector of the adjoining
parishes of Lound and Bradwell), and here he found
that sublime quietude which his soul loved.</p>
<p>That popular seaside resort, Great Yarmouth, was
first seen by Dickens at the close of 1848, and he
thought it &ldquo;the strangest place in the wide world,
one hundred and forty-six miles of hill-less marsh
between it and London&rdquo;; substituting the word
&ldquo;country&rdquo; for &ldquo;marsh,&rdquo; the statement would be
practically correct. Strongly impressed by the exceptional
and Dutch-like features of this flat expanse,
on the eastern margin of which stands the celebrated
seaport, he forthwith decided to &ldquo;try his hand&rdquo; at
it, with the result (as everyone knows) that he placed
there, on the open Denes, the home of Little Em&rsquo;ly
and the Peggottys. In all probability the idea of
causing them to live in a discarded boat arose from
his having seen a humble abode of this character
when perambulating the outskirts of Yarmouth, for
such domiciles were not uncommon in those days,
and might be met with both in Yarmouth and
Lowestoft; indeed, we are told that even now the
little village of Carracross, on the west coast of
Ireland, consists of seventeen superannuated fishing-boats,
one of which dates from about 1740. Apropos
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
of Peggotty&rsquo;s boat, it may be remarked that the old
inverted boat, bricked up and roofed in, which revealed
itself in 1879 during the process of demolition,
has hitherto been considered as the veritable domicile
immortalized in &ldquo;Copperfield&rdquo;; but the cherished
belief is not worthy of credence, being unsupported
by trustworthy evidence, an important point antagonistic
to that conjecture being the fact that Peggotty&rsquo;s
boat stood on the open Denes upon its keel (&ldquo;Phiz&rdquo;
notwithstanding), whereas that discovered in Tower
Road was put keel uppermost, by a shrimper, on
garden ground in the midst of a noisome locality
called by the inappropriate name &ldquo;Angel&rsquo;s Piece,&rdquo;
with no &ldquo;sandy waste&rdquo; surrounding it.<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a></p>
<p>At Yarmouth Dickens made his headquarters at
the Royal Hotel, on the sea-front, having John
Leech and Mark Lemon as congenial companions,
for illness prevented Forster from remaining with
them. The old town, and the flat, sandy expanse of
uncultivated land between river and sea, already
alluded to as the Denes, deeply imprinted itself upon
Dickens&rsquo;s mental retina, and he conveys his impressions
thereof through the medium of his boy-hero:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked rather spongy and sloppy, I thought,
as I carried my eye over the great dull waste that
lay across the river; and I could not help wondering,
if the world were really as round as my geography
book said, how any part of it came to be so flat.
But I reflected that Yarmouth might be situated at
one of the poles, which would account for it.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE GEORGE, GRETA BRIDGE. (<i><a href="#Page_123">Page 123</a>.</i>)
<br />Dickens visited this inn when collecting material for &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; and here Mr. Squeers alighted from the coach on his return from London with the new boys.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;As we drew a little nearer, and saw the whole
adjacent prospect lying a straight low line under the
sky, I hinted to Peggotty that a mound or so might
improve it, and also that if the land had been a little
more separated from the sea, and the town and the
tide had not been quite so much mixed up, like toast-and-water,
it would have been nicer....</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we got into the street (which was strange
enough to me), and smelt the fish, and pitch, and
oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors walking about,
and the carts jingling up and down over the stones,
I felt that I had done so busy a place an injustice,
and said as much to Peggotty, who ... told me it
was well known ... that Yarmouth was, upon the
whole, the finest place in the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David, as Ham carried him on his broad back
from the carrier&rsquo;s cart to the boathouse, gazed upon
the dreary amplitude of the Denes in anxious expectation
of catching a glimpse of the romantic abode
for which they were destined. &ldquo;We turned down
lanes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;bestrewn with bits of chips and
little hillocks of sand, and went past gasworks, rope-walks,
boat-builders&rsquo; yards, shipwrights&rsquo; yards, ship-breakers&rsquo;
yards, caulkers&rsquo; yards, riggers&rsquo; lofts, smiths&rsquo;
forges, and a great litter of such places, until we came
out upon the dull waste I had already seen at a
distance.... I looked in all directions, as far as I
could stare over the wilderness, and away at the sea,
and away at the river, but no house could <i>I</i> make
out&rdquo;&mdash;nothing except a &ldquo;ship-looking thing,&rdquo; which
presently resolved itself into the identical house for
which they were bound, and proved to be&mdash;in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
boy&rsquo;s estimation, at least&mdash;as charming and delightful
as Aladdin&rsquo;s palace, &ldquo;roc&rsquo;s egg and all.&rdquo; It is pointed
out by Dr. Bately that the description given by
Dickens (as above quoted) of the various objects seen
on the way from Yarmouth to the South Denes really
reverses their order, just as he noted them when
walking in the contrary direction. There are not
many boat-builders&rsquo; yards now remaining hereabouts.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN THE NORTH.</span></h2>
<p>In 1837 Dickens&rsquo;s thoughts were concentrated upon
a new serial story, &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; in which
he determined to expose the shortcomings of cheap
boarding-schools then flourishing in Northern England,
his first impressions of which were picked up
when, as a child, he sat &ldquo;in by-places, near Rochester
Castle, with a head full of Partridge, Strap, Tom
Pipes, and Sancho Panza.&rdquo; The time had arrived
(he thought) when, by means of his writings, he
could secure a large audience, to whom he might
effectively present the actual facts concerning the
alleged cruelties customarily practised at those seminaries
of which he had heard so much. Having
thus resolved to punish the culprits by means of his
powerful pen, and, if possible, to suppress the evils
of the system they favoured, the novelist and his
illustrator, &ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; departed from London by coach
on a cold winter&rsquo;s day in January, 1838, for Greta
Bridge, in the North Riding, with the express intention
of obtaining authoritative information regarding
the subject of the schools, for in that locality were
situated some of the most culpable of those institutions.
Greta Bridge takes its name from a lofty
bridge of one arch, erected on the line of Watling
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
Street, upon the site of a more ancient structure,
over the river Greta, a little above its junction with
the Tees.</p>
<p>The parish of Rokeby, in the petty sessional division
of Greta Bridge, is celebrated as the scene of Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;Rokeby,&rdquo; which was written
on the spot, and does no more than justice to the
beautiful scenery of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Dickens and &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; broke their journey at
Grantham, at which town they arrived late on the
night of January 30, and put up at the George&mdash;&ldquo;the
very best inn I have ever put up at.&rdquo; Early
the next morning they continued their journey by
the Glasgow mail, &ldquo;which charged us the remarkably
low sum of &pound;6 fare for two places inside.&rdquo; Snow
began to fall, and the drifts grew deeper, until there
was &ldquo;no vestige of a track&rdquo; over the wild heaths as
the coach approached the destination of the two
fellow-travellers, who were half frozen on their
arrival at Greta Bridge. In the story the author
gives the name of the hostelry where Squeers and his
party alighted from the coach as the George and
New Inn; but, in so doing, he indulges in an
artistic license, for he thus bestows upon one house
the respective signs of two distinct inns at Greta
Bridge, situated about half a mile from each other.
The George stands near the bridge already referred
to, the public portion of the premises having since
been converted into a private residence. The New
Inn has also been changed, and is now a farmhouse
called Thorpe Grange; built before the railway era
for Mr. Morrit, the landlord of the George, it not
only rivalled the older establishment, but absorbed
its custom, the owner claiming it as the veritable inn
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
of Dickens&rsquo;s story.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a> It seems very probable that
the novelist himself put up at the New Inn during
his brief tour of investigation in 1838; writing
thence to his wife at this date, he said that at 11 p.m.
the mail reached &ldquo;a bare place with a house standing
alone in the midst of a dreary moor, which the guard
informed us was Greta Bridge. I was in a perfect
agony of apprehension, for it was fearfully cold, and
there were no outward signs of anybody being up in
the house. But to our great joy we discovered a
comfortable room, with drawn curtains and a most
blazing fire. In half an hour they gave us a smoking
supper and a bottle of mulled port (in which we
drank your health), and then we retired to a couple
of capital bedrooms, in each of which there was a
rousing fire halfway up the chimney. We have had
for breakfast toast, cakes, a Yorkshire pie, a piece of
beef about the size and much the shape of my
portmanteau, tea, coffee, ham and eggs, and are now
going to look about us....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> After exploring the
immediate neighbourhood, Dickens, accompanied by
&ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; went by post-chaise to Barnard Castle, four
miles from Greta Bridge, and just over the Yorkshire
border, there to deliver a letter given to him by
Mr. Smithson (a London solicitor, who had a Yorkshire
connection), and to visit the numerous schools
thereabouts. This letter of introduction bore reference
(as the author explains in his preface to
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo;) to a supposititious little boy
who had been left with a widowed mother who didn&rsquo;t
know what to do with him; the poor lady had
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
thought, as a means of thawing the tardy compassion
of her relations on his behalf, of sending him to a
Yorkshire school. &ldquo;I was the poor lady&rsquo;s friend,
travelling that way; and if the recipient of the letter
could inform me of a school in his neighbourhood,
the writer would be very much obliged.&rdquo; The result
of this &ldquo;pious fraud&rdquo; (as Dickens himself termed
it) has become a matter of history. The person to
whom the missive was addressed was a farmer (since
identified as John S&mdash;&mdash;, of Broadiswood), who appears
in the story as honest John Browdie. Not being at
home when the novelist called upon him, he journeyed
through the snow to the inn where Dickens was
staying, and entreated him to advise the widow to
refrain from sending her boy to any of those wretched
schools &ldquo;while there&rsquo;s a harse to hoold in a&rsquo; Lunnun,
or a goother to lie asleep in!&rdquo; The old coaching-house
where this memorable interview is believed to
have taken place was the still existing Unicorn at
Bowes. Another inn associated with this tour of
inspection is the King&rsquo;s Head, Barnard Castle,<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a>
where Dickens made a brief stay, and where he
observed, across the way, the name of &ldquo;Humphreys,
clockmaker,&rdquo; over a shop door, this suggesting the
title of his next work, &ldquo;Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>It was at Bowes where he obtained material which
served him for depicting the &ldquo;internal economy&rdquo; of
Dotheboys Hall, in the school presided over by
William Shaw, who, it has since transpired, was by
no means the worst of his tribe. As a matter of fact,
he won respect from his neighbours, and is remembered
by many of his pupils (some of whom attained
high positions in various professions) as a worthy and
much injured man. In &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; however,
he became a scapegoat for others who thoroughly
deserved the punishment inflicted upon Shaw. Even
to-day many of the people at Bowes regard Dickens&rsquo;s
attack as unjust so far as that particular schoolmaster
is concerned, and visitors to the place
are advised to refrain from alluding to Dotheboys
Hall.</p>
<p>There is no lack of evidence to prove the general
accuracy of the novelist&rsquo;s description, and to him we
owe a deep debt of gratitude for so successful an
attempt to annihilate those terrible &ldquo;Caves of
Despair.&rdquo; Bowes is situated high up on the moorland,
and may now be reached by railway from
Barnard Castle. The village consists principally of
one street nearly three-quarters of a mile in length,
running east to west, and is lighted with oil lamps,
under a village lighting committee. Shaw&rsquo;s house
(known generally as Dotheboys Hall until recent
times) stands at the western extremity of Bowes.
The present tenants have altered somewhat the
original appearance of the house by attempting to
convert it into a kind of suburban villa&mdash;in fact, it
is now called &ldquo;The Villa.&rdquo; Prior to these structural
changes it was a long, low building of two storeys.
The classroom and dormitories were demolished a
few years ago, but the original pump, at which
Shaw&rsquo;s pupils used to wash, is still in the yard at the
back of the house, and an object of great interest to
tourists.</p>
<p>Nearly all provincial towns in England were visited
by Dickens during his acting and reading tours, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
many can boast of more intimate relations with the
novelist. It was from Liverpool, on January 4, 1842,
that he embarked on board the <i>Britannia</i> for the
United States&mdash;his first memorable visit to Transatlantic
shores&mdash;and in 1844 he presided at a great
public meeting held in the Mechanics&rsquo; Institution,
then sadly in need of funds, on which occasion he
delivered a powerful speech in support of the objects
of that foundation. Referring to the building, he said:
&ldquo;It is an enormous place. The lecture-room ...
will accommodate over thirteen hundred people....
I should think it an easy place to speak in, being a
semicircle with seats rising one above another to the
ceiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Respecting this function, we learn from a contemporary
report that long before the hour appointed
for the opening of the doors the street was crowded
with persons anxious to obtain admission, so anxious
were they to see and hear the young man (then only
in his thirty-third year) who had given them
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby.&rdquo; At the termination of his speech a vote
of thanks was accorded to the novelist, who, in
replying thereto, concluded his acknowledgments by
quoting the words of Tiny Tim, &ldquo;God bless us
every one.&rdquo; An interesting incident lay in the fact
that the young lady who presided at the pianoforte
was Miss Christina Weller, who, with her father,
was introduced to the author of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; thus
causing considerable merriment.</p>

<br />Visited by Dickens when writing &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>In 1847 Dickens and his distinguished company
of amateur actors gave a representation in Liverpool
of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s comedy, &ldquo;Every Man in His
Humour,&rdquo; for the benefit of Leigh Hunt. The
Reading tours in the fifties and sixties again called
him to that busy mercantile centre, one of the readings
taking place in St. George&rsquo;s Hall&mdash;&ldquo;the beautiful
St. George&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; as he described it: &ldquo;brilliant to
see when lighted up, and for a reading simply perfect.&rdquo;
One of the closing incidents of his life was the great
Liverpool banquet, which took place on April 10,
1869, in St. George&rsquo;s Hall, after his country Readings,
the late Marquis of Dufferin presiding, the function
being made memorable by an eloquent speech by the
novelist, replying to a remonstrance from Lord
Houghton against his (Dickens&rsquo;s) objection to entering
public life.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> While sojourning at Liverpool he
usually stayed at the Adelphi Hotel. In 1844 he
made Radley&rsquo;s Hotel his headquarters.</p>
<p>It is quite in accordance with our expectations to
find frequent mention of Liverpool throughout
Dickens&rsquo;s works. For descriptive passages we must
turn to the pages of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rdquo; and
certain of his minor writings, where we discover
interesting and important references &ldquo;to that rich and
beautiful port,&rdquo; as he calls it in one instance.
Apropos of the return to England of Martin
Chuzzlewit the younger and his faithful companion
Mark Tapley after their trying experiences in the
New Country, the novelist, in thus depicting Liverpool
and the Mersey, doubtless records his own impressions
of some two years previous on his arrival there
at the termination, in 1842, of his American tour:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was mid-day and high-water in the English
port for which the <i>Screw</i> was bound, when, borne in
gallantly upon the fulness of the tide, she let go her
anchor in the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bright as the scene was&mdash;fresh, and full of
motion; airy, free, and sparkling&mdash;it was nothing to
the life and exaltation in the hearts of the two
travellers at sight of the old churches, roofs, and
darkened chimney-stacks of home. The distant
roar that swelled up hoarsely from the busy streets
was music in their ears; the lines of people gazing
from the wharves were friends held dear; the canopy
of smoke that overhung the town was brighter and
more beautiful to them than if the richest silks of
Persia had been waving in the air. And though the
water, going on its glistening track, turned ever and
again aside to dance and sparkle round great ships,
and heave them up, and leaped from off the blades of
oars, a shower of diving diamonds, and wantoned
with the idle boats, and swiftly passed, in many
a sporting chase, through obdurate old iron rings, set
deep into the stonework of the quays, not even it
was half so buoyant and so restless as their fluttering
hearts, when yearning to set foot once more on
native ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of &ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller&rdquo; papers
(1860) will be found this vivid pen-picture of the
slums of Liverpool, favoured by seafaring men of the
lower class, a district probably little altered since
those lines were penned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A labyrinth of dismal courts and blind alleys,
called &lsquo;entries,&rsquo; kept in wonderful order by the
police, and in much better order than by the Corporation,
the want of gaslight in the most dangerous and
infamous of these places being quite unworthy of
so spirited a town.... Many of these sailors&rsquo;
resorts we attained by noisome passages so profoundly
dark that we felt our way with our hands. Not
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
one of the whole number we visited was without its
show of prints and ornamental crockery, the quantity
of the latter, set forth on little shelves and in little
cases in otherwise wretched rooms, indicating that
Mercantile Jack must have an extraordinary fondness
for crockery to necessitate so much of that bait in
his traps ... etc.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a></p>
<p>With the characteristics of that other great
Lancashire town, Manchester, the novelist became,
perhaps, even more intimate. &ldquo;Manchester is (<i>for</i>
Manchester) bright and fresh,&rdquo; he wrote to Miss
Hogarth from the Queen&rsquo;s Hotel in 1869, where he
stayed on the occasion of his Farewell Readings in the
provinces, and where the chimney of his sitting-room
caught fire and compelled him to &ldquo;turn out elsewhere
to breakfast.&rdquo; Long before this date&mdash;that is, in 1843&mdash;the
people of Manchester were first privileged to
meet him on the occasion of a bazaar in the Free
Trade Hall in aid of the fund for improving the
financial condition of the Athen&aelig;um, then sadly
in debt. The bazaar was followed by a soir&eacute;e, held in
the same building, under the presidency of Dickens,
who then delivered a speech which has been described
as &ldquo;a masterpiece of graceful eloquence.&rdquo; The
subject thereof forcibly appealed to him&mdash;viz., the
education of the very poor, for he did not believe in
the old adage that averred a little learning to be
a &ldquo;dangerous thing,&rdquo; but rather that the most
minute particle of knowledge is preferable to
complete and consummate ignorance. This memorable
function is noteworthy also by reason of the fact
that among the speakers who addressed the vast
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
audience were Disraeli and Cobden. Dickens
expressed a wish to become a member of the
Athen&aelig;um, but left Manchester without going
through the necessary formalities&mdash;an oversight soon
rectified, however.</p>
<p>In 1852, on the occasion of the inauguration of
the Manchester Public Free Libraries, the novelist
accepted an invitation to be present at an important
meeting held at Campfield, the &ldquo;first home&rdquo; of these
free libraries (formerly known as &ldquo;The Hall of
Science&rdquo;); the meeting was attended by a number
of distinguished men, including Bulwer Lytton,
Thackeray, John Bright, Peter Cunningham, etc.,
and it naturally fell to Dickens to make a speech,
having the use of literature as its theme. Thackeray,
by the way, had prepared a careful oration, but, after
delivering half a sentence, ignominiously sat down!
Public oratory was not his forte. In 1858 Dickens
presided at the annual meeting of the Institutional
Association of Lancashire and Cheshire, held in the
Manchester Athen&aelig;um and the Free Trade Hall,
and handed prizes to candidates from more than a
hundred local mechanics&rsquo; institutes affiliated to the
association. &ldquo;Knowledge has a very limited power
indeed,&rdquo; he observed, in the speech delivered on
behalf of the Manchester Mechanics&rsquo; Institute in
Cooper Street, &ldquo;when it informs the head alone; but
when it informs the head and heart too, it has power
over life and death, the body and the soul, and
dominates the universe.&rdquo; We are reminded that
this peroration is an echo of words in &ldquo;Hard Times&rdquo;
(written four years previously), and that his exhortation
to the Manchester audience practically reproduced
the leading thought in that powerful novel&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
story which impelled the admiration of Ruskin,
who, commenting upon it, said that the book
&ldquo;should be studied with close and earnest care by
persons interested in social questions.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Hard
Times&rdquo; Manchester is disguised as matter-of-fact
Coketown, and the presentment is easily recognisable:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a town of red brick, or of brick that
would have been red if the smoke and ashes had
allowed it; but, as matters stood, it was a town of
unnatural red and black, like the painted face of a
savage. It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys,
out of which interminable serpents of smoke
trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got
uncoiled. It had a black canal in it, and a river that
ran purple with evil-smelling dye, and vast piles of
building full of windows, where there was a rattling
and a trembling all day long, and where the piston
of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and
down, like the head of an elephant in a state of
melancholy madness. It contained several large
streets, all very like one another, and many small
streets, still more like one another, inhabited by
people equally like one another, who all went in
and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon
the same pavements, to do the same work, and to
whom every day was the same as yesterday and
to-morrow, and every year the counterpart of the
last and the next. These attributes of Coketown
were in the main inseparable from the work by
which it was sustained; against them were to be set
off comforts of life which found their way all over
the world, and elegancies of life which made we will
not ask how much of the fine lady, who could
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
scarcely bear to hear the place mentioned. You
saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely
workful....</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hardest working part of Coketown; in the
innermost fortifications of that ugly citadel, where
Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs
and gasses were bricked in; at the heart of the labyrinth
of narrow courts upon courts, and close streets
upon streets, which had come into existence piecemeal,
every piece in a violent hurry for some one
man&rsquo;s purpose, and the whole one unnatural family,
shouldering, and trampling, and pressing one another
to death; in the last close nook of the great exhausted
receiver, where the chimneys, for want or
air to make a draught, were built in an immense
variety of stunted and crooked shapes, as though
every house put out a sign of the kind of people
who might be expected to be born in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of Coketown on a sunny midsummer day (for
&ldquo;there was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown&rdquo;)
the author exhibits a realistic picture.
&ldquo;Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown
lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared
impervious to the sun&rsquo;s rays. You only knew the
town was there because you knew there could have
been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without
a town. A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly
bending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the
vault of heaven, now murkily creeping along the
earth as the wind rose and fell or changed its
quarter&mdash;a dense, formless jumble, with sheets of
cross-light in it, that showed nothing but masses of
darkness. Coketown in the distance was suggestive
of itself, though not a brick of it could be seen ...
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
the streets were hot and dusty on the summer day,
and the sun was so bright that it even shone through
the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown, and
could not be looked at steadily. Stokers emerged
from low underground doorways and factory yards,
and sat on steps, and posts, and palings, wiping their
swarthy visages, and contemplating coals. The
whole town seemed to be frying in oil. There was
a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere. The steam-engines
shone with it; the dresses of the Hands were
soiled with it; the mills throughout their many
stories oozed and trickled it. The atmosphere of
those Fairy palaces<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a> was like the breath of the
simoon, and their inhabitants, wasting with heat,
toiled languidly in the desert. But no temperature
made the melancholy-mad elephants more mad or
more sane. Their wearisome heads went up and
down at the same rate, in hot weather and cold, wet
weather and dry, fair weather and foul. The
measured motion of their shadows on the walls was
the substitute Coketown had to show for the shadows
of rustling woods; while for the summer hum of
insects it could offer, all the year round, from the
dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday, the whir
of shafts and wheels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drowsily they whirred all through this sunny
day, making the passenger more sleepy and more
hot as he passed the humming walls of the mills.
Sun-blinds and sprinklings of water a little cooled
the main streets and shops, but the mills and the
courts and the alleys baked at a fierce heat. Down
upon the river, that was black and thick with dye,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
some Coketown boys, who were at large&mdash;a rare
sight there&mdash;rowed a crazy boat, which made a
spurious track upon the water as it jogged along,
while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a></p>
<p>Apropos of &ldquo;Hard Times,&rdquo; it may be mentioned
that in 1854 Dickens stayed at the Bull Hotel in
Preston, when he visited that town expressly for the
purpose of witnessing the effects of a strike in a
manufacturing town. He failed, however, to secure
much material here for the story, for he wrote: &ldquo;Except
the crowds at the street-corners reading the placards
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, and the cold absence of smoke from the
mill-chimneys, there is very little in the streets to
make the town remarkable.&rdquo; He expected to find
in Preston a model town, instead of which it proved
to be, in his estimation, a &ldquo;nasty place,&rdquo; while to
the Bull he referred in disrespectful terms as an
&ldquo;old, grubby, smoky, mean, intensely formal red-brick
house, with a narrow gateway and a dingy
yard.&rdquo; Preston figures in the early chapters of
&ldquo;George Silverman&rsquo;s Explanation,&rdquo; a cellar in that
town being the birthplace of the principal character,
the Rev. George Silverman.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE RED LION, BARNET. (<i><a href="#Page_173">Page 173</a>.</i>)
<br />Dickens and Forster dined here in March, 1838, to celebrate the birth of Miss Mary (Mamie) Dickens.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Reverting to Manchester, it must not be forgotten
that Dickens, in the capacity of an actor, journeyed
thither four times, appearing with his amateur company
first at the Theatre Royal in 1847 for the
benefit of Leigh Hunt, twice in 1852 at the Old
Free Trade Hall, and again in that building in 1857.
Needless to say, the performances attracted vast and
enthusiastic audiences, and were eminently successful
both artistically and financially.</p>
<p>The Free Trade Hall, too, was the scene of his
public Readings in Manchester, and it is recorded
that he was accustomed to stay at Old Trafford as
the guest of Mr. John Knowles, of the Theatre
Royal. This large house was then surrounded by
an extensive wood, and considered to be a lonely
and remote place, but is now near a network of
railways, and the reverse of rural.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a></p>
<p>About the year 1841 Charles Dickens&rsquo;s elder
sister Fanny (nearly two years his senior) married
Henry Burnett, an accomplished operatic singer,
who had retired from performing on the stage, and
taken up his abode in Manchester as an instructor in
music, Mrs. Burnett, herself a musician of considerable
acquirements, assisting her husband in conducting
the choir of Rusholme Road Congregational
Chapel, where they worshipped, and the pastor of
which was the Rev. James Griffin, who has recorded
in print his recollections of the Burnetts. There is,
consequently, a link of a distinctly personal kind
connecting Dickens with Manchester, which is made
additionally interesting by the fact that the little
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
crippled son of the Burnetts (who lived in Upper
Brook Street) was the prototype of Paul Dombey.
It may be added that Mr. Burnett unconsciously
posed for some of the characteristics of Nicholas
Nickleby, while in Fanny Dorrit there are certain
indications suggesting that her portrait was inspired
by the novelist&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>In a literary sense, Manchester can boast of other
Dickensian associations, for here resided the originals
of the delightful Cheeryble Brothers, who (the
author assures us in his preface to &ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby&rdquo;) were &ldquo;very slightly and imperfectly
sketched&rdquo; from life. &ldquo;Those who take an interest
in this tale,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;will be glad to learn that the
Brothers Cheeryble live; that their liberal charity,
their singleness of heart, their noble nature, and
their unbounded benevolence, are no creation of the
author&rsquo;s brain, but are prompting every day (and
oftenest by stealth) some munificent deed in that
town of which they are the pride and honour.&rdquo; The
actual models whence he portrayed the Cheerybles
with approximate accuracy were the brothers Grant,
William and Daniel, merchants, of Ramsbottom and
Manchester, with whom the novelist declared he
&ldquo;never interchanged any communication in his life.&rdquo;
From evidence recently forthcoming, however, we
learn that in 1838 (the year prior to the publication
of &ldquo;Nickleby&rdquo;) he and Forster were the guests of
Mr. Gilbert Winter, of Stocks House, Cheetham
Hill Road, Manchester, to whom they went with a
letter of introduction from Harrison Ainsworth.
Stocks House (demolished in 1884) was formerly
surrounded by a moat, a portion of which was filled
up at the time of the construction of the old road to
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
Bury, the fine old mansion probably representing
the manor-house of Cheetham Manor, given as a
reward to the Earls of Derby after the Battle of
Bosworth Field. It was at Stocks House that
Dickens became acquainted with the Grants; indeed,
Forster practically admits this when he says: &ldquo;A
friend now especially welcome was the novelist
Mr. Ainsworth, with whom we visited, during two
of those years (1838 and 1839), friends of art and
letters in his native Manchester, from among whom
Dickens brought away the Brothers Cheeryble....&rdquo;
The Rev. Hume Elliot informs us that although
William and Daniel Grant had residences in Manchester,
they preferred to live together at Springside,
Ramsbottom, &ldquo;which they made a veritable home of
hospitality and good works,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> and it is fair to assume
that Dickens must have seen at their home the
original of David, &ldquo;the apoplectic butler,&rdquo; or ascertained
from an authentic source the peculiarities of
Alfred, who served the Grants in a like capacity and
possessed similar idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>There are two houses in Manchester associated
with the Grants. One of these, now a parcel-receiving
office of the London and North-Western
Railway Company, is in Mosley Street, and the other
(a more important place) stands at the lower end of
Cannon Street (No. 15), a large, roomy warehouse,
occupied by a paper dealer, who caused the name
&ldquo;Cheeryble House&rdquo; to be placed on the front of the
building.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>The rare combination of the qualities of charity
and humanity with sound business instincts, such as
are ascribed to the Cheeryble Brothers, was exactly
true of the Grants. On the death of William Grant
(the elder brother) in 1842, the novelist (writing
from Niagara Falls to his American friend, Professor
Felton), said: &ldquo;One of the noble hearts who sat for
the Cheeryble Brothers is dead. If I had been in
England I would certainly have gone into mourning
for the loss of such a glorious life. His brother is
not expected to survive him. [He died in 1855, at
the age of seventy-five.] I am told that it appears
from a memorandum found among the papers of the
deceased that in his lifetime he gave away &pound;600,000,
or three million dollars.&rdquo; There is a marble tablet
to the memory of William Grant in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Presbyterian Church, Ramsbottom, recording his
&ldquo;vigour of understanding, his spotless integrity of
character, and his true benevolence of heart.... If
you are in poverty,&rdquo; the inscription continues,
&ldquo;grieve for the loss of so good a friend; if born to
wealth and influence, think of the importance of
such a trust, and earn in like manner by a life of
charitable exertion the respect and love of all who
knew you, and the prayers and blessings of the
poor.&rdquo; Honoured descendants of the two philanthropists
are still surviving in the city which cherishes
their memory.</p>
<p>In 1847 the novelist presided at a meeting of the
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute in Leeds, thus proving his
practical interest in the welfare of working men&mdash;an
interest again testified in 1855, when he visited
Sheffield for the purpose of reading the &ldquo;Christmas
Carol&rdquo; in the Mechanics&rsquo; Hall on behalf of the funds
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
of the Institute in that busy town. After the reading,
the Mayor begged his acceptance of a handsome
service of table cutlery and other useful articles of
local manufacture, the gift of a few gentlemen in
Sheffield, as a substantial manifestation of their
gratitude to him.</p>
<p>In a letter to Wilkie Collins, dated August 29,
1857, Dickens said: &ldquo;I want to cast about whether
you and I can go anywhere&mdash;take any tour&mdash;see
anything&mdash;whereon we could write something
together. Have you any idea tending to any place
in the world? Will you rattle your head and see
if there is any pebble in it which we could wander
away and play at marbles with?&rdquo; This was written
just after the conclusion of the readings and theatrical
performances in aid of the Douglas Jerrold fund,
Dickens experiencing a sense of restlessness when the
excitement attending them had subsided, and seeming
anxious &ldquo;to escape from himself&rdquo; by means of a
pilgrimage with a congenial companion, and such
as might provide material for a series of papers in
<i>Household Words</i>. Arrangements were speedily
made with this object, and the two friends started
forthwith &ldquo;on a ten or twelve days&rsquo; expedition to
out-of-the-way places, to do (in inns and coast
corners) a little tour in search of an article and in
avoidance of railroads.&rdquo; They decided for a foray
upon the fells of Cumberland, Dickens having discovered
(in &ldquo;The Beauties of England and Wales&rdquo;
and other topographical works) descriptions of
&ldquo;some promising moors and bleak places thereabout.&rdquo;
To the Lake district they accordingly
departed in September, and their adventures are
related in &ldquo;The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
(published in <i>Household Words</i> during the
latter part of the same year), the authors skilfully
collaborating in the preparation of the record, nearly
all the descriptive passages emanating from the pen
of Dickens. Almost the first thing attempted by the
travellers was the climbing of Carrock Fell, &ldquo;a gloomy
old mountain 1,500 feet high.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nobody goes
up,&rdquo; said Dickens to Forster; &ldquo;guides have forgotten
it.&rdquo; The proprietor of a little inn, however,
volunteered his services as guide, and the party of
enthusiasts ascended in a downpour of rain. The
Two Idle Apprentices (who bear the respective names
Francis Goodchild and Thomas Idle, the former
being the pseudonym favoured by Dickens) concluded
that to perform the feat &ldquo;would be the culminating
triumph of Idleness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Up hill and down hill, and
twisting to the left, and with old Skiddaw (who has
vaunted himself a great deal more than his merits
deserve, but that is rather the way of the Lake
country) dodging the apprentices in a picturesque
and pleasant manner. Good, weatherproof, warm,
pleasant houses, well white-limed, scantily dotting
the road.... Well-cultivated gardens attached
to the cottages.... Lonely nooks, and wild; but
people can be born, and married, and buried in such
nooks, and can live, and love, and be loved there as
elsewhere, thank God!&rdquo; The village is portrayed as
consisting of &ldquo;black, coarse-stoned, rough-windowed
houses, some with outer staircases, like Swiss houses,
a sinuous and stony gutter winding up hill and
round the corner by way of street.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a> The ascent
of the mountain was safely achieved, but during the
descent Collins unfortunately fell into a watercourse
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
and sprained his ankle, an accident which proved to
be a serious hindrance. They slept that night at
Wigton, which (we are told) &ldquo;had no population,
no business, no streets to speak of.&rdquo; In <i>Household
Words</i> may be found an elaborate, amusing (but
doubtless accurate) description of Wigton marketplace
as seen at night nearly fifty years ago, and
written with Dickens&rsquo;s customary power, illustrating
his marvellous acuteness of observation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wigton market was over, and its bare booths
were smoking with rain all down the street....
&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Brother Francis, &lsquo;what I hope and
believe to be one of the most dismal places ever seen
by eyes. I see the houses with their roofs of dull
black, their stained fronts, and their dark-rimmed
windows, looking as if they were all in mourning.
As every little puff of wind comes down the street,
I see a perfect train of rain let off along the wooden
stalls in the market-place and exploded against me.
I see a very big gas-lamp in the centre, which I know,
by a secret instinct, will not be lighted to-night. I
see a pump, with a trivet underneath its spout
whereon to stand the vessels that are brought to be
filled with water. I see a man come to the pump,
and he pumps very hard; but no water follows, and
he strolls empty away.... I see one, two, three,
four, five linen-drapers&rsquo; shops in front of me. I see
a linen-draper&rsquo;s shop next door to the right, and
there are five more linen-drapers&rsquo; shops round the
corner to the left. Eleven homicidal linen-drapers&rsquo;
shops within a short stone&rsquo;s-throw, each with its hands
at the throats of all the rest! Over the small first-floor
of one of these linen-drapers&rsquo; shops appears the
wonderful inscription: <i>BANK</i>.... I see a sweet-meat
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
shop, which the proprietor calls a &lsquo;Salt Warehouse.&rsquo;...
And I see a watchmaker&rsquo;s, with only
three great pale watches of a dull metal hanging in
his window, each on a separate pane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... There is nothing more to see, except the
curl-paper bill of the theatre ... and the short,
square, chunky omnibus that goes to the railway, and
leads too rattling a life over the stones to hold together
long. Oh yes! Now I see two men with their hands
in their pockets ... they are looking at nothing
very hard, very hard ... they spit at times, but speak
not. I see it growing darker, and I still see them,
sole visible population of the place, standing to be
rained upon, with their backs towards me, and looking
at nothing very hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... The murky shadows are gathering fast,
and the wings of evening and the wings of coal are
folding over Wigton.... And now the town
goes to sleep, undazzled by the large unlighted lamp
in the market-place; and let no man wake it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a></p>
<p>From Wigton the friends proceeded to Allonby,
on the coast of Cumberland, here resolving to begin
their writing, to record their impressions while fresh
in their minds. They found a comfortable lodging,
a &ldquo;capital little homely inn,&rdquo; the Ship, overlooking
the watery expanse, and by a curious coincidence the
landlady previously lived at Greta Bridge, Yorkshire,
when Dickens went there in quest of the cheap
boarding-schools.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/p_145fp.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="553" />
<p class="pcap">THE ALBION HOTEL, BROADSTAIRS. (<i><a href="#Page_189">Page 189</a>.</i>)
<br />Dickens stayed at this hotel on several occasions, and in 1839 lodged at a house &ldquo;two doors from the Albion,&rdquo; and there &ldquo;Nickleby&rdquo; was finished.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>The Ship still flourishes as a &ldquo;family and commercial
hotel and posting-house, commanding extensive
views of the Solway Firth and the Scottish hills.&rdquo;
Dickens thought Allonby the dullest place he ever
entered, rendered additionally dull by &ldquo;the monotony
of an idle sea,&rdquo; and in sad contrast to the expectations
formed of it. &ldquo;A little place with fifty houses,&rdquo; said
Dickens in a letter home, &ldquo;five bathing-machines,
five girls in straw hats, five men in straw hats, and
no other company. The little houses are all in half-mourning&mdash;yellow
stone or white stone, and black;
and it reminds me of what Broadstairs might have
been if it had not inherited a cliff, and had been an
Irishman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the opinion of Mr. Francis Goodchild, Allonby
was the most &ldquo;delightful place ever seen.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was
what you might call a primitive place. Large? No,
it was not large. Who ever expected it would be
large? Shape? What a question to ask! No
shape. Shops? Yes, of course (quite indignant).
How many? Who ever went into a place to count
the shops? Ever so many. Six? Perhaps. A
library? Why, of course (indignant again). Good
collection of books? Most likely&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t say&mdash;had
seen nothing in it but a pair of scales. Any
reading-room? Of course there was a reading-room!
Where? Where! Why, over there. Where
was over there? Why, <i>there</i>! Let Mr. Idle carry
his eye to that bit of waste ground above high-water
mark, where the rank grass and loose stones were
most in a litter, and he could see a sort of a long
ruinous brick loft, next door to a ruinous brick outhouse,
which loft had a ladder outside to get up by.
That was the reading-room, and if Mr. Idle didn&rsquo;t
like the idea of a weaver&rsquo;s shuttle throbbing under a
reading-room, that was his look-out. <i>He</i> was not to
dictate, Mr. Goodchild supposed (indignant again),
to the company.&rdquo; In short, he declared that &ldquo;if
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
you wanted to be primitive, you could be primitive
here, and if you wanted to be idle, you could be idle
here,&rdquo; as were the local fishermen, who (apparently)
never fished, but &ldquo;got their living entirely by looking
at the ocean.&rdquo; The &ldquo;public buildings&rdquo; at Allonby
were the two small bridges over the brook &ldquo;which
crawled or stopped between the houses and the sea.&rdquo;
As if to make amends for these shortcomings, Nature
provided fine sunsets at Allonby, &ldquo;when the low, flat
beach, with its pools of water and its dry patches,
changed into long bars of silver and gold in various
states of burnishing,&rdquo; &ldquo;and there were fine views, on
fine days, of the Scottish coast.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a></p>
<p>From Allonby the two apprentices proceeded to
the county town, Carlisle, putting up at &ldquo;a capital
inn,&rdquo; kept by a man named Breach.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p_147fp.jpg" alt="" width="556" height="801" />
<p class="pcap">LAWN HOUSE, BROADSTAIRS. (<i><a href="#Page_193">Page 193</a>.</i>)
<br />Dickens occupied Lawn House in the summer of 1840, and the archway is mentioned in a letter to his wife dated September 3, 1850.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Carlisle &ldquo;looked congenially and delightfully
idle.... On market morning Carlisle woke up
amazingly, and became (to the two idle apprentices)
disagreeably and reproachfully busy. There were
its cattle-market, its sheep-market, and its pig-market
down by the river, with raw-boned and shock-headed
Rob Roys hiding their Lowland dresses beneath
heavy plaids, prowling in and out among the animals,
and flavouring the air with fumes of whisky. There
was its corn-market down the main street, with hum
of chaffering over open sacks. There was its general
market in the street, too, with heather brooms, on
which the purple flower still flourished, and heather
baskets primitive and fresh to behold. With women
trying on clogs and caps at open stalls, and &lsquo;Bible
stalls&rsquo; adjoining. With &lsquo;Dr. Mantle&rsquo;s Dispensary
for the Cure of all Human Maladies and no charge for
advice,&rsquo; and with &lsquo;Dr. Mantle&rsquo;s Laboratory of Medical,
Chemical, and Botanical Science,&rsquo; both healing institutions
established on one pair of trestles, one board,
and one sun-blind. With the renowned phrenologist
from London begging to be favoured (at 6d. each)
with the company of clients of both sexes, to whom,
on examination of their heads, he would make revelations
&lsquo;enabling him or her to know themselves.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a>
Maryport, a few miles south of Allonby, was also
inspected, and is described as &ldquo;a region which is a
bit of waterside Bristol, with a slice of Wapping, a
seasoning of Wolverhampton, and a garnish of Portsmouth&rdquo;&mdash;in
fact, a kind of topographical salad. To
the supposititious query addressed to it by one of the
apprentices, &ldquo;Will <i>you</i> come and be idle with me?&rdquo;
busy Maryport metaphorically shakes its head, and
sagaciously answers in the negative, for she declares:
&ldquo;I am a great deal too vaporous, and a great deal too
rusty, and a great deal too muddy, and a great deal
too dirty altogether; and I have ships to load, and
pitch and tar to boil, and iron to hammer, and steam
to get up, and smoke to make, and stone to quarry,
and fifty other disagreeable things to do, and I can&rsquo;t
be idle with you.&rdquo; Thus thrown upon his own resources,
this idle apprentice goes &ldquo;into jagged uphill
and downhill streets, where I am in the pastry-cook&rsquo;s
shop at one moment, and next moment in
savage fastnesses of moor and morass, beyond the
confines of civilization, and I say to those murky and
black-dusty streets: &lsquo;Will <i>you</i> come and be idle with
me?&rsquo; To which they reply: &lsquo;No, we can&rsquo;t indeed,
for we haven&rsquo;t the spirits, and we are startled by the
echo of your feet on the sharp pavement, and we
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
have so many goods in our shop-windows which
nobody wants, and we have so much to do for a
limited public which never comes to us to be done
for, that we are altogether out of sorts, and can&rsquo;t
enjoy ourselves with anyone.&rsquo; So I go to the Post-office
and knock at the shutter, and I say to the
Postmaster: &lsquo;Will <i>you</i> come and be idle with me?&rsquo;
This invitation is refused in cynical terms: &lsquo;No, I
really can&rsquo;t, for I live, as you may see, in such a very
little Post-office, and pass my life behind such a very
little shutter, that my hand, when I put it out, is as
the hand of a giant crammed through the window of
a dwarf&rsquo;s house at a fair, and I am a mere Post-office
anchorite in a cell made too small for him, and I
can&rsquo;t get in, even if I would.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a> Maryport of to-day
differs considerably from Maryport of nearly half a
century since, and it is doubtful if its inhabitants will
recognise the presentment.</p>
<p>Hesket-New-Market, &ldquo;that rugged old village on
the Cumberland Fells,&rdquo; was included in this itinerary
of irresponsible travelling, and of the ancient inn
where Idle and Goodchild sojourned, and of the
contents of their apartments, we have quite a pre-Raphaelite
picture:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ceiling of the drawing-room was so crossed
and recrossed by beams of unequal lengths, radiating
from a centre in the corner, that it looked like
a broken star-fish.... It had a snug fireside, and
a couple of well-curtained windows, looking out
upon the wild country behind the house. What it
most developed was an unexpected taste for little
ornaments and nick-nacks, of which it contained
a most surprising number.... There were books,
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
too, in this room.... It was very pleasant to see
these things in such a lonesome byplace; so very
agreeable to find these evidences of taste, however
homely, that went beyond the beautiful cleanliness
and trimness of the house; so fanciful to imagine
what a wonder the room must be to the little
children born in the gloomy village&mdash;what grand
impressions of it those of them who became wanderers
over the earth would carry away; and how, at
distant ends of the world, some old voyagers would
die, cherishing the belief that the finest apartment
known to man was once in the Hesket-New-Market
Inn, in rare old Cumberland.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> Dickens does not
give the name of the inn, but I have ascertained that
it was the Queen&rsquo;s Head, and that it is now a
dwelling-house, having the curious-timbered ceiling
intact, and still retaining its old-fashioned character.
An enclosure, fronting the building, has been planted
with shrubs by the present occupier, where it used to
be paved and open to the street&mdash;&ldquo;a sinuous and
stony gutter winding uphill and round the corner,&rdquo;
as Dickens termed the roadway through the still
quaint and interesting village of Hesket-New-Market.</p>
<p>On September 12, 1857, Dickens announced that
he and his companion were on their way to Doncaster,
<i>en route</i> for London. Breaking the journey at
Lancaster, they stopped at another delightful hostelry,
the King&rsquo;s Arms in Market Street. &ldquo;We are in a
very remarkable old house here,&rdquo; wrote Dickens to
his sister-in-law, &ldquo;with genuine old rooms and an
uncommonly quaint staircase. I have a state bedroom,
with two enormous red four-posters in it, each
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
as big as Charley&rsquo;s room at Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a> A more
detailed description, however, appears in the printed
record, where we read that &ldquo;the house was a
genuine old house of a very quaint description,
teeming with old carvings and beams, and panels,
and having an excellent old staircase, with a gallery
or upper staircase cut off from it by a curious fence-work
of old oak, or of the old Honduras mahogany
wood. It was, and is, and will be for many a long
year to come, a remarkably picturesque house; and
a certain grave mystery lurking in the depth of the
old mahogany panels, as if they were so many deep
pools of dark water&mdash;such, indeed, as they had been
much among when they were trees&mdash;gave it a very
mysterious character after nightfall.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a></p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Lazy Tour&rdquo; some particulars are given
concerning a curious custom at the King&rsquo;s Arms,
where they give you bride-cake every day after
dinner. This melodramatic love-story is presented
in the form of a narrative by one of the half-dozen
&ldquo;noiseless old men in black&rdquo; who acted as
waiters at the inn, whence we learn that the strange
custom originated in the traditional murder, by
poison, of a young bride in an apartment afterwards
known as the Bride&rsquo;s Chamber, the criminal being
subsequently hanged at Lancaster Castle. Around
the legend, in which money and pride and greed and
cruel revenge play a prominent part, Dickens threw
the halo of his wondrous fancy, and so stimulated
public interest in the hostelry that visitors thereto
were eager to see the alleged haunted chamber with
its antique bedstead of black oak, and to taste
the bride-cake in memory of the unfortunate young
woman.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Externally, the old King&rsquo;s Arms (situated at
the corner of Market Street and King&rsquo;s Street) was
not of a picturesque character, although a certain
quiet dignity was imparted to the stone frontage by
the broad windows extending from roof to basement,
and by the pillared doorway of the principal entrance.
When Mr. Sly left the old place in 1879, it was
pulled down, and a kind of commercial hotel erected
on the site, which narrowly escaped destruction
by fire in 1897. After his day the custom of having
bride-cake was discontinued, but it is interesting to
know that the famous oak bedstead (upon which
Dickens himself slept) is in the safe possession of the
Duke of Norfolk, for whom it was purchased at
a high price when the old oak fittings, etc., were
disposed of about twenty-seven years since. Mr. Sly,
who died in 1896, never tired of recalling the visit of
Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins, and the former
delighted the worthy landlord by presenting him with
a signed portrait of himself, inscribed, &ldquo;To his good
friend Mr. Sly,&rdquo; which is still retained by the family
as a cherished memento. Shortly after the publication
of &ldquo;The Lazy Tour&rdquo; Mr. Sly obtained permission
to reprint the descriptive chapter by Dickens,
for presentation to his guests; the pamphlet contained
illustrations representing the entrance-hall and staircase,
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
and this prefatory note: &ldquo;The reader is perhaps
aware that Mr. Charles Dickens and his friend
Mr. Wilkie Collins, in the year 1857, visited
Lancaster, and during their sojourn stopped at
Mr. Sly&rsquo;s, King&rsquo;s Arms Hotel. In the October
number of <i>Household Words</i>, under the title of &lsquo;The
Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices,&rsquo; Mr. Dickens
presents his readers with a remarkable story of a
Bridal Chamber, from whence the following extracts
are taken.&rdquo; Mr. J. Ashby-Sterry, writing in 1897,
alludes to the King&rsquo;s Arms as &ldquo;a rare old place, full
of antique furniture, curios, and musical bedsteads,&rdquo;
and says that its proprietor, Mr. Sly (who died about
a year previously), who took the greatest pride in his
admirable old inn, liked nothing better than taking
an appreciative visitor over the place and giving
amusing reminiscences of the memorable visit of the
authors of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Woman in
White.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>With regard to Lancaster itself, it would seem
that Dickens&rsquo;s opinion (as expressed by Francis
Goodchild) then was &ldquo;that if a visitor on his arrival
(there) could be accommodated with a pole which
could push the opposite side of the street some
yards farther off, it would be better for all parties&rdquo;;
but, while &ldquo;protesting against being obliged to live
in a trench,&rdquo; he conceded Lancaster to be a pleasant
place&mdash;&ldquo;a place dropped in the midst of a charming
landscape, a place with a fine ancient fragment of
castle, a place of lovely walks, a place possessing
staid old houses richly fitted with old Honduras
mahogany, which had grown so dark with time that
it seems to have got something of a retrospective
mirror-quality into itself, and to show the visitor, in
the depths of its grain, through all its polish, the
hue of the wretched slaves who groaned long ago
under old Lancaster merchants. And Mr. Goodchild
adds that the stones of Lancaster do sometimes
whisper even yet of rich men passed away&mdash;upon
whose great prosperity some of these old doorways
frowned sullen in the brightest weather&mdash;that their
slave-gain turned to curses, as the Arabian Wizard&rsquo;s
money turned to leaves, and that no good ever came
of it even unto the third and fourth generation, until
it was wasted and gone.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a> Concerning the lunatic
asylum at Lancaster there is a note of approval:
&ldquo;An immense place ... admirable offices, very
good arrangements, very good attendants,&rdquo; followed
by this truly Dickensian touch of sympathy and
pathos: &ldquo;Long groves of blighted men-and-women
trees; interminable avenues of hopeless faces;
numbers without the slightest power of really
combining for any earthly purpose; a society of
human creatures who have nothing in common but
that they have all lost the power of being humanly
social with one another.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></p>
<p>From Lancaster Francis Goodchild and Thomas
Idle took train to Leeds, &ldquo;of which enterprising
and important commercial centre it may be observed
with delicacy that you must either like it very much
or not at all.&rdquo; Next day, the first of the Race
Week, they proceed to Doncaster, and put up at that
noted establishment the Angel, still flourishing in
the principal thoroughfare as of yore. Here they
had &ldquo;very good, clean, and quiet apartments&rdquo; on
the second floor, looking down into the main street,
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
Dickens describing his own bedroom as &ldquo;airy and
clean, little dressing-room attached, eight water-jugs
(I never saw such a supply), capital sponge-bath,
perfect arrangement, and exquisite neatness.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a> That
great annual festival known as Race Week had just
begun, and the streets of Doncaster were full of
jockeys, betting men, drunkards, and other undesirable
persons, from morning to night&mdash;and all
night. From their windows the apprentices gazed
with interest and wonderment upon the motley
assemblage, for this was their first experience of the
St. Leger and its saturnalia.</p>

<p>We are assured by Forster that the description
here given in &ldquo;The Lazy Tour&rdquo; of Doncaster and
the races emanated from the pen of Wilkie Collins;
I venture, however, to believe that Dickens is more
likely to have composed the chapter in question, for
not only is it written in his characteristic vein, but
we find that when at Doncaster Thomas Idle (<i>i.e.</i>,
Collins) continued to suffer severely from the accident
to his ankle, which practically incapacitated
him, and evidently prevented him from witnessing
the races. In a letter written at this time Dickens
remarks: &ldquo;I am not going to the course this
morning, but have engaged a carriage (open, and
pair) for to-morrow and Friday.... We breakfast
at half-past eight, and fall to work for <i>H. W.</i> afterwards.
Then I go out, and&mdash;hem! look for
subjects.&rdquo; The first person singular here is significant,
indicating as it does that Collins did not
accompany his friend to the scenes so vividly and
realistically portrayed in the final chapter of the
&ldquo;Tour.&rdquo; In respect of the visit to Doncaster, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
remarkable incident may be noted. Dickens, who
knew nothing (and cared less) about matters relating
to the turf, invested in a &ldquo;c&rsquo;rect card&rdquo;
containing the names of the horses and jockeys, and,
merely for the fun of the thing, wrote down three
names for the winners of the three chief races, &ldquo;and,
if you can believe it (he said to Forster) without
your hair standing on end, those three races were
won, one after another, by those three horses!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> It
was the St. Leger Day, which brought ill-fortune to
many, so that Dickens&rsquo;s &ldquo;half-appalling kind of luck&rdquo;
seemed to him especially to be a &ldquo;wonderful, paralyzing
coincidence.&rdquo; He sincerely believed that if
a boy with any good in him, but with a damning
propensity to sporting and betting, were taken to
the Doncaster Races soon enough, it would cure
him, so terrible is the revolting exhibition of
rascality and the seamy side of humanity.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Scotland may justly lay claim to an intimate
association with Charles Dickens. With the picturesque
streets of Edinburgh he first became
familiar in 1834, during his reporting days, when he
and his colleague, Thomas Beard, represented the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i> at a grand banquet given at the
Scottish capital in honour of the then Prime Minister,
Earl Grey, the two young reporters going by sea
from London to Leith. This fact explains how
Dickens secured such an accurate presentment of
the old town of Edinburgh as we find in &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo;
in the forty-eighth chapter of which Arthur&rsquo;s Seat is
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
described as &ldquo;towering, surly and dark, like some
gruff genius, over the ancient city he has watched so
long,&rdquo; while Canongate (as seen by the hero of
&ldquo;The Story of the Bagman&rsquo;s Uncle&rdquo;) is represented
as consisting of &ldquo;tall, gaunt, straggling houses, with
time-stained fronts, and windows that seemed to
have shared the lot of eyes in mortals, and to have
grown dim and sunken with age. Six, seven, eight
stories high were the houses; story piled above
story, as children build with cards, throwing their
dark shadows over the roughly-paved road, and
making the night darker. A few oil lamps were
scattered at long distances, but they only served to
mark the dirty entrance to some narrow close, or to
show where a common stair communicated, by steep
and intricate windings, with the various flats above.&rdquo;
We are told that Tom Smart&rsquo;s uncle, on reaching
the North Bridge connecting the old town with the
new, &ldquo;stopped for a minute to look at the strange
irregular clusters of lights piled one above the other,
and twinkling afar off so high that they looked like
stars, gleaming from the castle walls on the one
side and the Calton Hill on the other, as if they
illuminated veritable castles in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach-yard (or rather enclosure) in Leith
Walk, by which Tom had to pass on the way to his
lodging, and where he saw the vision of the old
mail-coach with its passengers, actually existed at
that spot, and was owned by Mr. Croall, whose
family disposed of the carriages and coaches, but
subsequently owned all the cabs in the city. Dickens
afterwards visited Edinburgh on at least four occasions,
staying at the Waterloo Hotel in 1861 and
at Kennedy&rsquo;s in 1868, during his Reading tours,
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
and on the latter occasion he observed: &ldquo;Improvement
is beginning to knock the old town of
Edinburgh about here and there; but the Canongate
and the most picturesque of the horrible courts
and wynds are not to be easily spoiled, or made fit
for the poor wretches who people them to live in.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a>
The Scott Monument he could not but regard as a
failure, considering that it resembles the spire of a
Gothic church taken off and stuck in the ground.</p>
<p>In 1841, on the eve of his departure for the
United States, the &ldquo;Inimitable Boz,&rdquo; accompanied
by his wife, made Scotland his destination for a
summer holiday tour in &ldquo;Rob Roy&rsquo;s country,&rdquo; as he
termed it. He had thought of Ireland, but altered
his mind. The novelist received a magnificent
welcome, initiated by a public dinner in Edinburgh,
at which Professor Wilson presided. During their
brief stay in the Scottish capital Dickens found
excellent accommodation at the Royal Hotel, which
was consequently besieged, and he was compelled to
take refuge in a sequestered apartment at the end of
a long passage. His chambers here were &ldquo;a handsome
sitting-room, a spacious bedroom, and large dressing-room
adjoining,&rdquo; with another room at his disposal
for writing purposes, while from the windows he
obtained a noble view, in which the castle formed a
conspicuous object. From Edinburgh he travelled
to the Highlands, with intervals of rest, and
thoroughly admired the characteristic scenery of the
country. Especially was he impressed by the Pass of
Glencoe, which he had often longed to see, and which
he thought &ldquo;perfectly terrible.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pass,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;is an awful place. It is shut in on each side
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
by enormous rocks, from which great torrents come
rushing down in all directions. In amongst these
rocks on one side of the Pass ... there are scores
of glens high up, which form such haunts as you
might imagine yourself wandering in in the very
height and madness of a fever. They will live in
my dreams for years.... They really are fearful
in their grandeur and amazing solitude.&rdquo; Indeed,
&ldquo;that awful Glencoe,&rdquo; as he called it, exercised a kind
of fascination over him which proved irresistible,
compelling him to revisit the spot the next day, when
he found it &ldquo;absolutely horrific,&rdquo; for &ldquo;it had rained
all night, and ... through the whole glen, which is
ten miles long, torrents were boiling and foaming,
and sending up in every direction spray like the
smoke of great fires. They were rushing down
every hill and mountain side, and tearing like devils
across the path, and down into the depths of the
rocks.... One great torrent came roaring down
with a deafening noise and a rushing of water that
was quite appalling.... The sights and sounds
were beyond description.&rdquo; This and other adventures
during his journeyings hereabouts were vividly
described in letters to Forster, who has printed the
major portion of them in his biography, and a
very attractive record it is.</p>
<p>Before returning southward, the novelist became
the recipient of an invitation to a public dinner at
Glasgow; but, yearning for home, he pleaded pressing
business connected with &ldquo;Master Humphrey&rsquo;s
Clock,&rdquo; then appearing in weekly numbers, promising,
however, to return a few months later and accept the
honour then. Illness unfortunately prevented the
fulfilment of that promise, and six years elapsed
(1847) before he made acquaintance with that city,
when he performed the ceremony of opening the
Glasgow Athen&aelig;um, which was followed by a soir&eacute;e
in the City Hall. In 1858 he was recommended by
some of the students for election as Lord Rector of
Glasgow University, in opposition to his own wish,
but received only a few votes.</p>

His paid Readings subsequently took him to the
leading cities in Scotland, and in 1868 he wrote from
the Royal Hotel, Glasgow (his customary quarters
there): &ldquo;The atmosphere of this place, compounded
of mists from the Highlands and smoke from the
town factories, is crushing my eyebrows as I write,
and it rains as it never does rain anywhere else, and
always does rain here. It is a dreadful place, though

the northern wilds of Yorkshire, is memorable also
for another &ldquo;bachelor excursion,&rdquo; the two friends
travelling by road through the Midlands in the late

from the coach office near Hungerford Street, Strand,
having booked seats to Leamington, where, on
arrival, after a very agreeable (but very cold) journey,
they found &ldquo;a roaring fire, an elegant dinner, a snug
room, and capital beds&rdquo; awaiting them. The
&ldquo;capital inn&rdquo; affording these creature comforts to
the two benumbed passengers was Copps&rsquo;s Royal
Hotel, to which reference is made in &ldquo;Dombey and

<p>The next morning Dickens and &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; drove in
a post-chaise to Kenilworth, &ldquo;with which we were
both enraptured&rdquo; (the novelist observed in a letter
to his wife), &ldquo;and where I really think we <i>must</i> have
lodgings next summer, please God that we are in
good health and all goes well. You cannot conceive
how delightful it is. To read among the ruins in
fine weather would be perfect luxury.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a> A similar
opinion is recorded in his private diary: &ldquo;Away to
Kenilworth&mdash;delightful&mdash;beautiful beyond expression.
Mem.: What a summer resort!&mdash;three
months lie about the ruins&mdash;books&mdash;thinking&mdash;seriously
turn this over next year.&rdquo; Thence they
proceeded to Warwick Castle, to which Dickens referred
with less enthusiasm in the same epistle as
&ldquo;an ancient building, newly restored, and possessing
no very great attraction beyond a fine view and some
beautiful pictures&rdquo;; thence to Stratford-on-Avon,
where both novelist and artist &ldquo;sat down in the
room where Shakespeare was born, and left our
autographs and read those of other people, and so
forth.&rdquo; Dickens&rsquo;s entry in the diary recording this
circumstance is reminiscent of Alfred Jingle&rsquo;s staccato
style; thus: &ldquo;Stratford&mdash;Shakespeare&mdash;the birthplace,
visitors, scribblers, old woman&mdash;Qy. whether
she knows what Shakespeare did, etc.&rdquo; The secretary
and librarian of Shakespeare&rsquo;s birthplace (Mr. Richard
Savage) informs me that he has understood that
these signatures of Dickens and &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; were
written upon one of the plaster panels in the birth-room,
but have since been destroyed; the church
albums for the years 1848 and 1852 contain signatures
of Dickens and of the members of his amateur
theatrical company, then touring to raise funds for
charitable purposes.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>It is evident that Dickens&rsquo;s first impressions of
Stratford were recalled in &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo;
where Mrs. Nickleby remarks, in her usual inconsequent
manner, upon the visit of herself and her
husband to the birthplace, and their lodging at a
hostelry in the town. Warwick, Kenilworth, and
the neighbourhood the author remembered when
writing the twenty-seventh chapter of &ldquo;Dombey
and Son,&rdquo; in the description of that &ldquo;most enchanting
expedition&rdquo; to the castle: &ldquo;Associations of the
Middle Ages, and all that, which is so truly exquisite,&rdquo;
exclaimed Cleopatra with rapture; &ldquo;such
charming times! So full of faith! So vigorous
and forcible! So picturesque! So perfectly removed
from the commonplace!... Pictures at
the castle, quite divine!&rdquo; &ldquo;Those darling bygone
times,&rdquo; she observed to Mr. Carker, bent upon
showing him the beauties of that historic pile, &ldquo;with
their delicious fortresses, and their dear old dungeons,
and their delightful places of torture, and their
romantic vengeances, and their picturesque assaults
and sieges, and everything that makes life truly
charming! How dreadfully we have degenerated!&rdquo;
Cleopatra and the rest of the little party &ldquo;made the
tour of the pictures, the walls, crow&rsquo;s nest, and so
forth,&rdquo; and the castle &ldquo;being at length pretty well
exhausted,&rdquo; and Edith Grainger having completed
a sketch of the exterior of the ancient building (concerning
which sketch Mr. Carker fawningly avowed
that he was unprepared &ldquo;for anything so beautiful,
and so unusual altogether&rdquo;), a stroll among the
haunted ruins of Kenilworth, &ldquo;and more rides to
more points of view ... brought the day&rsquo;s expedition

<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Quitting Stratford the next day, Dickens and his
companion intended to proceed to Bridgnorth; but
were dismayed to find there were no coaches, which
fact compelled them to continue their journey to
Shrewsbury and Chester by way of Birmingham and
Wolverhampton, &ldquo;starting by eight o&rsquo;clock through
a cold, wet fog, and travelling, when the day had
cleared up, through miles of cinder-paths, and
blazing furnaces, and roaring steam-engines, and such
a mass of dirt, gloom, and misery, as I never before
witnessed.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> His impressions of the Black Country
are vividly portrayed in the forty-third and succeeding
chapters of &ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop,&rdquo; and there
is good reason to suppose that a portion at least of
the itinerary of the pilgrimage of little Nell and her
grandfather, after their flight from London to escape
from the evil influence of Quilp, was based upon his
own tour, undertaken two years previously. Indeed,
so far as the above-mentioned chapter is concerned,
there is evidence of this in a letter to Forster, apropos
of the story, where the novelist says: &ldquo;You will
recognise a description of the road we travelled
between Birmingham and Wolverhampton; but I
had conceived it so well in my mind that the execution
does not please me so well as I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the depressing effect wrought upon
the mind of the traveller through the Black Country,
it is gratifying to know that a project is seriously
contemplated by which this scene of waste and desolation
may be restored to its original condition by
reafforestation. Sir Oliver Lodge recently presided
at an important meeting held in Birmingham to consider
the question, and it was agreed that, now that
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
the mineral wealth of the locality had been exhausted,
it was only right that the surface of the land should
be altered for good by a system of tree-planting, the
land itself being rendered useless for mining, agriculture,
and habitation.</p>
<p>Birmingham is mentioned frequently throughout
the works of Dickens, who visited the city on several
occasions, staying at one time at the old Hen and
Chickens Inn. He must have known this important
manufacturing centre in his journalistic days, for he
made it the scene of that well-remembered incident
recorded in the fiftieth chapter of &ldquo;The Pickwick
Papers,&rdquo; where Mr. Pickwick calls upon Mr. Winkle,
senior, with a difficult and delicate commission.
When the post-coach conveying Mr. Pickwick and
his friends drew near it was quite dark, &ldquo;the straggling
cottages by the roadside; the dingy hue of every
object visible; the murky atmosphere; the paths of
cinders and brick-dust; the deep red glow of furnace
fires in the distance; the volumes of dense smoke
issuing heavily forth from high, toppling chimneys,
blackening and obscuring everything around; the
glare of distant lights; the ponderous waggons which
toiled along the road laden with clashing rods of
iron, or piled with heavy goods&mdash;all betokened their
rapid approach to the great working town of
Birmingham. As they rattled through the narrow
thoroughfares leading to the heart of the turmoil,
the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck
more forcibly on the senses. The streets were
thronged with working people. The hum of labour
resounded from every house, lights gleamed from
the long casement windows in the attic stories, and
the whirl of wheels and noise of machinery shook
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
the trembling walls. The fires, whose lurid, sullen
light had been visible for miles, blazed fiercely up
in the great works and factories of the town. The
din of hammers, the rushing of steam, and the dead,
heavy clanking of engines, was the harsh music
which arose from every quarter.&rdquo; The postboy,
driving briskly through the open streets and past the
&ldquo;handsome and well-lighted shops&rdquo; on the outskirts
of the town, drew up at the Old Royal Hotel, where
they were shown to a comfortable apartment. The
<i>Old</i> Royal survives in name only, the present building
having been so altered and modernized as to bear no
resemblance to the three-storied structure, with its
plain, square front and Georgian porch, which temporarily
sheltered Mr. Pickwick. The residence of
the elder Mr. Winkle (&ldquo;a wharfinger, Sir, near the
canal&rdquo;), whose name is a familiar one in Birmingham,
is believed to be a certain red-brick building in Easy
Row, in close proximity to the Old Wharf, a house
which, with its white steps leading to the doorway,
answers fairly well to the description given in the
book.</p>
<p>In 1844 Dickens presided at a meeting of the
Polytechnic Institution at Birmingham, and delivered
a powerful oration upon the subject of education,
comprehensive and unsectarian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A better and quicker audience,&rdquo; he afterwards
remarked, &ldquo;never listened to man&rdquo;; and, in honour
of the event, the large hall was profusely decorated
with artificial flowers, these also forming the words
&ldquo;Welcome, Boz,&rdquo; in letters about 6 feet high, while
about the great organ were immense transparencies
bearing designs of an allegorical character. In 1857
he was elected one of the first honorary members of
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
the Birmingham and Midland Institute, in which
institution he had always taken an active interest.
In January, 1853, at the rooms of the Society of
Artists, Temple Row, a large company assembled to
witness the presentation to Dickens of a silver-gilt
salver and diamond ring, in recognition of valuable
services rendered in aid of the fund then being raised
for the establishment of the Institute, and as a token
of appreciation of his &ldquo;varied literary acquirements,
genial philosophy, and high moral teaching.&rdquo; At
the great banquet which followed this interesting
function, he offered to give Readings from his books
in further aid, and the promise was fulfilled in
December, 1853, with the result that nearly &pound;500
were added to the fund; to commemorate these
first public Readings, Mrs. Dickens became the
recipient of a silver flower-basket.</p>
<p>Other Readings were given in Birmingham in the
sixties. In September, 1869, he opened the session
of the Midland Institute, the ceremony being
rendered memorable by a powerful speech, in which
he thus briefly declared his political creed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faith in the people governing is, on the
whole, infinitesimal; my faith in the people governed
is, on the whole, illimitable.&rdquo; In 1870, as President
of the Institute, he distributed at the Town Hall the
prizes and certificates awarded to the most successful
students; one of the prize-winners was a Miss
Winkle, whose name (so reminiscent of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;)
was received with good-humoured laughter, and it
is recorded that the novelist, after making some
remarks to the lady in an undertone, observed to the
audience that he had &ldquo;recommended Miss Winkle
to change her name!&rdquo;</p>

<br />Some of the earlier chapters, of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; were written here.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>If a brief note in the diary (under date October 31,
1838) may be accepted as evidence, the travellers
stayed at the White Lion in Factory Road, Wolverhampton.
Twenty years later (August and November,
1858) Dickens gave public Readings here, and on the
first occasion there was a performance of &ldquo;Oliver
Twist&rdquo; at the local theatre, &ldquo;in consequence (he
opined) of the illustrious author honouring the town
with his presence.&rdquo; Writing at this time of the
appearance of the country through which he had then
passed, he said that it &ldquo;looked at its blackest&rdquo;; &ldquo;all the
furnaces seemed in full blast, and all the coal-pits to
be working.... It is market-day here (Wolverhampton),
and the ironmasters are standing out in the
street (where they always hold high change), making
such an iron hum and buzz that they confuse me
horribly. In addition there is a bellman announcing
something&mdash;not the Readings, I beg to say&mdash;and
there is an excavation being made in the centre
of the open place, for a statue, or a pump, or a lamppost,
or something or other, round which all the
Wolverhampton boys are yelling and struggling.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a></p>
<p>Reverting to the tour of 1838, Dickens and
&ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; left Wolverhampton for Shrewsbury (the
next stage), making their quarters at the old-fashioned
Lion Hotel, which establishment the novelist revisited
during the provincial Reading tour of 1858,
when he thus described the inn to his elder
daughter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the strangest little rooms (sitting-room
and two bedrooms altogether), the ceilings of which
I can touch with my hand. The windows bulge
out over the street, as if they were little stern
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
windows in a ship. And a door opens out of the
sitting-room on to a little open gallery with plants in it,
where one leans over a queer old rail, and looks all
downhill and slantwise at the crookedest black and
yellow old houses, all manner of shapes except straight
shapes. To get into this room we come through a china
closet; and the man in laying the cloth has actually
knocked down, in that repository, two geraniums and
Napoleon Bonaparte.&rdquo; This quaint establishment, alas!
has been modernized (if not entirely rebuilt) since
those days, and presents nothing of the picturesqueness
that attracted the author of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo; Shrewsbury,
however, still retains and cherishes several of its
&ldquo;black and yellow&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, half-timbered) houses, and
it is probably this town which we find thus portrayed
in the forty-sixth chapter of &ldquo;The Old Curiosity
Shop&rdquo;: &ldquo;In the streets were a number of old houses,
built of a kind of earth or plaster, crossed and re-crossed
in a great many directions with black beams,
which gave them a remarkable and very ancient look.
The doors, too, were arched and low, some with
oaken portals and quaint benches, where the former
inhabitants had sat on summer evenings. The
windows were latticed in little diamond panes, that
seemed to wink and blink upon the passengers as
if they were dim of sight.&rdquo; On the night of their
arrival at Shrewsbury, Dickens and &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; were
present at a &ldquo;bespeak&rdquo; at the theatre, and witnessed
a performance of &ldquo;The Love Chase,&rdquo; a ballet (&ldquo;with
a phenomenon!&rdquo;),<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> followed by divers songs, and
the play of &ldquo;A Roland for an Oliver.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is
a good theatre,&rdquo; was the novelist&rsquo;s comment, &ldquo;but
the actors are very funny. Browne laughed with
such indecent heartiness at one point of the entertainment
that an old gentleman in the next box suffered
the most violent indignation. The bespeak party
occupied two boxes; the ladies were full-dressed, and
the gentlemen, to a man, in white gloves with
flowers in their button-holes. It amused us mightily,
and was really as like the Miss Snevellicci business
as it could well be.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a></p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>From the diary we learn that the friends journeyed
by post-coach from Shrewsbury over the Welsh border
to Llangollen, passing two aqueducts by the way&mdash;&ldquo;beautiful
road between the mountains&mdash;old abbey
at the top of mountain, Denis Brien or Rook Castle&mdash;Hand
Hotel&mdash;Mrs. Phillips&mdash;Good.&rdquo; The
parish of Llangollen is intersected by the celebrated
aqueduct of Pont-y-Lycylltan, and contiguous thereto
stands Valle Crucis Abbey. Thence the itinerary
included Bangor, Capel Curig, Conway, Chester,
Birkenhead, Manchester (Adelphi Hotel), and
Cheadle. There is good reason for supposing that
Dickens, during this tour, availed himself of the
opportunity of visiting the peaceful and picturesque
village of Tong, on the north-eastern borders of the
county of Salop, and that he probably posted there
from Shrewsbury; for he assured the late Archdeacon
Lloyd that Tong Church is the veritable
church described in &ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop&rdquo;
as the scene of little Nell&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very aged, ghostly place; the church
had been built many hundreds of years ago, and had
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
once had a convent or monastery attached; for arches
in ruins, remains of oriel windows, and fragments
of blackened walls, were yet standing; while other
portions of the old building, which had crumbled
away and fallen down, were mingled with the churchyard
earth and overgrown with grass, as if they
too claimed a burying-place and sought to mix their
ashes with the dust of men.&rdquo; Tong Church was
erected about the year 1411, and is a fine specimen
of Gothic architecture of the Early Perpendicular
period. Owing to its fine monuments it is called
&ldquo;The Westminster Abbey of the Midlands.&rdquo; There
yet remain the original oak choir-stalls with the
miserere seats and carved poppy-heads; the old oak
roof with its sculptured bosses; the painted screens
in the aisles, of very rich workmanship; and the
beautiful Vernon Chantry, called &ldquo;The Golden
Chapel,&rdquo; from its costly ornamentation, referred to
in the story as the &ldquo;baronial chapel.&rdquo; The sacred
edifice underwent various reparations during the
period between 1810 and 1838, still presenting,
however, an exceedingly picturesque aspect when the
novelist beheld it in the latter year. Although a more
thorough restoration took place in 1892, we are
assured that no old features have been destroyed, but
doubtless much of the halo of antiquity, which
imparts a poetical charm to such structures, is not so
evident as of yore. That Dickens derived inspiration
from Tong and its environment for the &ldquo;local
colouring&rdquo; in chap. xlvi. and later chapters of
&ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop&rdquo; it is impossible to
doubt.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>In December, 1858, Dickens was entertained at a
public dinner at the Castle Hotel, Coventry, on
the occasion of receiving a gold repeater watch of
special construction by the watchmakers of the town.
This gift was tendered as a mark of gratitude for his
Reading of the &ldquo;Christmas Carol,&rdquo; given a year
previously in aid of the funds of the Coventry
Institute. In acknowledging this testimonial the recipient
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This watch, with which you have presented me,
shall be my companion in my hours of sedentary
working at home and in my wanderings abroad. It
shall never be absent from my side, and it shall
reckon off the labours of my future days....
And when I have done with time and its measurement,
this watch shall belong to my children;
and as I have seven boys, and as they have all
begun to serve their country in various ways, or
to elect into what distant regions they shall roam, it
is not only possible, but probable, that this little
voice will be heard scores of years hence&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;in some yet unfounded city in the wilds of
Australia, or communicating Greenwich time to
Coventry Street, Japan.... From my heart of
hearts I can assure you that the memory of to-night,
and of your picturesque and ancient city, will never
be absent from my mind, and I can never more hear
the lightest mention of the name of Coventry
without having inspired in my breast sentiments of
unusual emotion and unusual attachment.&rdquo; The
novelist bequeathed the watch (and the chain and
seals worn with it) to his &ldquo;dear and trusty friend&rdquo;
John Forster.</p>
<p>In 1849 Dickens was an honoured guest at Rockingham
Castle, Northamptonshire, the home of his
friends the Hon. Richard Watson and Mrs. Watson.
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
Writing thence to Forster, he said: &ldquo;Picture to
yourself, my dear F., a large old castle, approached by
an ancient keep (gateway), portcullis, etc., filled with
company, waited on by six-and-twenty servants ...
and you will have a faint idea of the mansion
in which I am at present staying....&rdquo; His visits
to Rockingham were often repeated, and in the
winter of 1850 he there supervised the construction
of &ldquo;a very elegant little theatre,&rdquo; of which he constituted
himself the manager, and early in the
following year the theatre opened with performances
of &ldquo;Used Up,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Animal Magnetism,&rdquo; with the
novelist himself and members of his family in the
cast of both plays. Charles Dickens the younger
considered that Rockingham Castle bears much more
than an accidental resemblance to Chesney Wold, the
Lincolnshire mansion of Sir Leicester Dedlock in
&ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; upon which story his father was
engaged at the period here referred to. Indeed, the
author himself confessed as much to Mrs. Watson
when he said: &ldquo;In some of the descriptions of
Chesney Wold I have taken many bits, chiefly about
trees and shadows, from observations made at Rockingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The castle is situated on a breezy eminence overlooking
the valley of the Welland, which river overflows
occasionally and floods the surrounding country,
suggesting the watery Lincolnshire landscape described
in the second chapter of &ldquo;Bleak House.&rdquo;
At the end of the terrace is the Yew Walk, corresponding
with the Ghost&rsquo;s Walk at Chesney Wold,
and there is a sundial in the garden, also referred to
in the story. After passing under the archway,
flanked by ancient bastion towers (the remains of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
former castle), a general view is obtained of the north
front of the mansion, one of the principal apartments
in which is the long drawing-room, the veritable
drawing-room of Chesney Wold, except that the fireplace
is surmounted by a carved overmantel instead
of a portrait, while the family presentments at
Rockingham are in the hall, and not in the drawing-room,
as related of those at Chesney Wold. The
village of Rockingham consists of one street,
which ascends the hill in the direction of the castle
lodge; on the right as we enter the village stands
&ldquo;a small inn&rdquo; called the Sondes Arms, the prototype
of the Dedlock Arms, which bears the date
1763. The &ldquo;solemn little church&rdquo; in the park,
with its old carved oak pulpit, has been restored and
enlarged within the last thirty years. A footpath
leading to the church from the village street undoubtedly
answers to Lawrence Boythorn&rsquo;s disputed
right-of-way, concerning which that impulsive gentleman
waxes eloquent in the ninth chapter of &ldquo;Bleak
House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the county of Hertford Dickens always retained
agreeable memories; he frequently followed
the advice once offered by him to W. H. Wills, to
&ldquo;take a cheery flutter into the air of Hertfordshire.&rdquo;
During the early years of his literary career he
indulged a fondness for horse exercise, and, generally
accompanied by Forster, would ride to some destination
a few miles out of London, take luncheon at
some favourite hostelry, and thus enjoy a day&rsquo;s
recreation. Their usual refreshment-house on the
Great North Road was the Red Lion at High
Barnet, in which town Oliver Twist, footsore and
weary, found a temporary resting-place on a cold
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
doorstep, and wondered at the great number of
taverns there existing, for (as related in the story)
&ldquo;every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or
small.&rdquo; We read in the same story that the infamous
Bill Sikes, in his flight after the murder of Nancy,
eventually reached Hatfield, turning down &ldquo;the hill
by the church of the quiet village, and, plodding along
the little street, crept into a small public-house....&rdquo;
It is evident that Dickens knew Hatfield intimately,
the topography of which has since undergone
considerable alteration in consequence of the
invasion of the Great Northern Railway. The
&ldquo;small public-house&rdquo; entered by Sikes was in all
probability that quaint little ale-house the Eight
Bells, still flourishing at the bottom of the main
street, while the &ldquo;little post-office,&rdquo; where he recognised
the mail from London, at that time adjoined
the Salisbury Arms (now a private residence), at
which establishment Dickens himself doubtless stayed
on the night of October 27, 1838, when he and
&ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; made their &ldquo;bachelor excursion&rdquo; to the
West Country.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> Hatfield is introduced in &ldquo;Mrs.
Lirriper&rsquo;s Lodgings,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a> for here, in the rural churchyard,
Mr. Lirriper was buried; not that Hatfield
was his native place (explains the bereaved widow
pathetically), &ldquo;but that he had a liking for the
Salisbury Arms, where we went upon our wedding-day,
and passed as happy a fortnight as ever happy
was.&rdquo; In after-years she &ldquo;put a sandwich and a
drop of sherry in a little basket and went down to
Hatfield churchyard, outside the coach, and kissed
my hand and laid it with a kind of a proud and
swelling love on my husband&rsquo;s grave, though, bless
you! it had taken me so long to clear his name that
my wedding-ring was worn quite fine and smooth
when I laid it on the green, green, waving grass.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Mr. Lirriper&rsquo;s youngest brother, by the way, who
was something of a scapegrace, also retained a sneaking
affection for the Salisbury Arms, derived from
less sentimental reasons; here he enjoyed himself
for the space of a fortnight, and left without paying
his bill, an omission speedily rectified by the kind-hearted
Mrs. Lirriper, in the innocent belief that it
was fraternal affection which induced her unprincipled
brother-in-law to favour Hatfield with his presence.</p>
<p>In 1859 Dickens became much interested in a
working men&rsquo;s club established at Rothamsted by
the late Sir John Bennet Lawes, the renowned
scientist, the purpose of this club being to enable
all agricultural labourers of the parish to enjoy their
ale and pipes independently of the public-house.
The novelist, accompanied by his brother-in-law,
Henry Austin, drove to Rothamsted for the express
purpose of inspecting this novel institution, which
numbers to-day nearly 200 members, and was so
delighted with what he saw and heard respecting it
that he not only published an article on the subject,<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a>
but eagerly recommended the formation of such
clubs in other country neighbourhoods. Sir John
Lawes is, of course, the prototype of Friar Bacon in
the article aforesaid, where the worthy baronet&rsquo;s
beautiful manor-house (in which his son and heir
now resides) is thus described: &ldquo;The sun burst forth
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
gaily in the afternoon, and gilded the old gables, and
old mullioned windows, and old weathercock, and
old clock-face, of the quaint old house which is the
dwelling of the man we sought. How shall I describe
him? As one of the most famous practical
chemists of the age? That designation will do as
well as another&mdash;better, perhaps, than most others.
And his name? Friar Bacon.... We walked on
the trim garden terrace before dinner, among the
early leaves and blossoms; two peacocks, apparently
in very tight new boots, occasionally crossing the
gravel at a distance. The sun shining through the
old house-windows now and then flashed out some
brilliant piece of colour from bright hangings within,
or upon the old oak panelling; similarly, Friar Bacon,
as we paced to and fro, revealed little glimpses of
his good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; Hertfordshire plays a conspicuous
part, and it is generally believed that the
original of John Jarndyce&rsquo;s residence, which gives
its name to the story, is to be discovered in or near
St. Albans, as mentioned in the book itself. Indeed,
a picturesque Early Georgian building at the top of
Gombards Road (on the northern outskirts of the
city) has been christened &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; in the
supposition that it was the veritable home of Mr.
Jarndyce; and there appears to be some justification
for this, as the position of the house in its relation
to the abbey church, and the characteristics of the
locality, are in harmony with the details particularized
in the story. There is evidence, too, that Dickens
lodged in St. Albans when engaged upon the early
chapters of his novel; he and Douglas Jerrold stayed
at the Queen&rsquo;s Hotel in Chequer Street, and it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
then rumoured in the town that the object of
Dickens&rsquo;s visit was to obtain &ldquo;local colour.&rdquo; His
younger brother Frederick and his friend Peter
Cunningham lived for a while in St. Albans, and it
is remembered by some of the older inhabitants that
the author of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; occasionally journeyed
to St. Albans, when opportunities arose, for a gossip
with those boon companions in their country retreat.</p>
<p>Of all Hertfordshire localities with which Dickens
formed an acquaintance, that claiming the most
intimate association with him is the pretty little
village of Knebworth, the ancestral home of the
Lyttons. A warm friendship existed between
Lord Lytton and his brother novelist, and when, in
1850, some private theatricals were arranged for
performance in the grand banqueting-hall, with
&ldquo;Boz&rdquo; and his goodly company of amateurs in the
cast (including Leech, Lemon, Tenniel, Stanfield,
Forster, and others), mirth and jollity reigned supreme.
The plays went off &ldquo;in a whirl of triumph&rdquo;
(wrote Dickens at the time), &ldquo;and fired the whole
length and breadth of Hertfordshire,&rdquo; which is not
surprising when the circumstances are recalled. At
Knebworth originated that unfortunate scheme known
as the &ldquo;Guild of Literature and Art,&rdquo; formulated by
Dickens and Lord Lytton for the amelioration of the
hardships of impecunious authors and artists, the
funds in aid of the project being augmented by the
proceeds derived from the theatrical entertainments.
It was intended to erect and endow a retreat for
such necessitous persons, and a block of houses (in
the Gothic style) was actually built upon ground
near the main road at Stevenage, given by Lord
Lytton for the purpose. Unhappily, these praiseworthy
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
efforts failed to appeal to those for whose
benefit they were designed, and the guild houses,
after remaining unoccupied for nearly twenty years,
were converted into &ldquo;suburban villas,&rdquo; the rents
being available for the relief of such applicants as
were qualified to receive it. It was generally believed
that the failure to secure tenants for the guild
houses under the special regulations was due chiefly
to the fact of their being regarded as little better than
almshouses, and too remote from London to be
easily accessible; it must not be forgotten, too, that
true genius looks askance at acts of charity performed
in its behalf, the spirit of independence which usually
characterizes it rebelling at anything that appears to
assume the form of patronage, although it must be
admitted that the guild rules give no cause for suspicion
on that score. Dickens, in a speech delivered
in 1865, after a survey of the newly-completed and
attractive domiciles, said: &ldquo;The ladies and gentlemen
whom we shall invite to occupy the houses we have
built will never be placed under any social disadvantage.
They will be invited to occupy them as
artists, receiving them as a mark of the high respect
in which they are held by their fellow-workers. As
artists, I hope they will often exercise their calling
within those walls for the general advantage; and
they will always claim, on equal terms, the hospitality
of their generous neighbour.&rdquo; But it was not to be,
and probably nothing proved so disappointing to
Dickens as the almost contemptuous indifference
with which this philanthropic proposal was received
both by the press and the public, who ridiculed it
unmercifully. As a memento of the scheme, there
may be seen nearly opposite the guild houses a roadside
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
tavern rejoicing in the sign of Our Mutual
Friend, intended as a delicate compliment to the
author of the story so entitled, then in course of
publication.</p>
<p>During a visit to Knebworth in 1861, Dickens
and Mr. (afterwards Sir) Arthur Helps&mdash;sometime
Queen&rsquo;s Secretary&mdash;called upon a most extraordinary
character, locally known as &ldquo;Mad Lucas,&rdquo; who lived
in an extremely miserly fashion in the kitchen of his
house (Elmwood House, at Redcoats Green, near
Stevenage). This strange recluse died of apoplexy
in 1874, and was buried in Hackney Churchyard;
his house, with its boarded-up windows, shored-up
walls, and dilapidated roof, continued to remain
an object of interest for many years afterwards, until
in 1893 it was razed to the ground and the materials
sold by public auction. James Lucas, &ldquo;the Hertfordshire
Hermit,&rdquo; was really a well-educated and
highly intellectual man, who inherited the estate of
his father, a prosperous West India merchant, and
it is conjectured that his distress at the death of his
widowed mother (who lived with him) was primarily
the cause of that mental aberration which assumed
such an eccentric form; he even refused to bury her
corpse, so that the local authorities were compelled
to resort to a subterfuge in order to perform themselves
the last rites. He objected to furnish his rooms,
and, attired simply in a loose blanket fastened with
a skewer, preferred to eat and sleep amidst the
cinders and rubbish-heaps (a sanctuary for rats)
which accumulated in the kitchen. Although his
diet consisted of bread and cheese, red herrings, and
gin, there were choice wines available for friendly
visitors, a special vintage of sherry being reserved
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
for ladies who thus honoured him. The hermit&rsquo;s
penchant for tramps attracted all the vagabonds in
the neighbourhood, so that it became necessary for
him to protect himself from insult by retaining
armed watchmen and barricading the house.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s Ground&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a> Dickens has depicted
a miserly recluse named Mopes, and it is
easy to discern that Lucas sat for the portrait&mdash;indeed,
it is said that in reading the number he
recognised the presentment, and expressed great
indignation at what he considered to be a much
exaggerated account of himself and his environment.
In the chapter devoted to Mr. Mopes, the novelist
tells us that he found his strange abode in &ldquo;a nook
in a rustic by-road, down among the pleasant dales
and trout-streams of a green English county.&rdquo; He
does not think it necessary for the reader to know
what county; suffice it to say that one &ldquo;may hunt
there, shoot there, fish there, traverse long grass-grown
Roman roads there, open ancient barrows
there, see many a mile of richly-cultivated land there,
and hold Arcadian talk with a bold peasantry, their
country&rsquo;s pride, who will tell you (if you want to
know) how pastoral housekeeping is done on nine
shillings a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those familiar with this portion of Hertfordshire
cannot fail to recognise in these allusions the neighbourhood
of Stevenage, and a clue to its identity is
afforded by the allusion to &ldquo;ancient barrows,&rdquo; for at
Stevenage there are some remarkable tumuli known
as the &ldquo;Six Hills,&rdquo; which are believed to be ancient
sepulchral barrows, or repositories of the dead. If
further evidence be required, it is forthcoming in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
following delightful portrayal of Stevenage itself, as
it appeared to Dickens over forty years ago:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning sun was hot and bright upon the
village street. The village street was like most
other village streets: wide for its height, silent for
its size, and drowsy in the dullest degree. The
quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters
(to shut up Nothing as carefully as if it were
the Mint or the Bank of England) had called in the
Doctor&rsquo;s house so suddenly that his brass doorplate
and three stories stood among them as conspicuous
and different as the Doctor himself in his broadcloth
among the smock frocks of his patients. The village
residences seem to have gone to law with a similar
absence of consideration, for a score of weak little
lath-and-plaster cabins clung in confusion about the
Attorney&rsquo;s red-brick house, which, with glaring doorsteps
and a most terrific scraper, seemed to serve all
manner of ejectments upon them. They were as
various as labourers&mdash;high-shouldered, wry-necked,
one-eyed, goggle-eyed, squinting, bow-legged, knock-kneed,
rheumatic, crazy; some of the small tradesmen&rsquo;s
houses, such as the crockery shop and the
harness-maker&rsquo;s, had a Cyclops window in the middle
of the gable, within an inch or two of its apex,
suggesting that some forlorn rural Prentice must
wriggle himself into that apartment horizontally,
when he retired to rest, after the manner of the
worm. So bountiful in its abundance was the surrounding
country, and so lean and scant the village,
that one might have thought the village had sown
and planted everything it once possessed to convert
the same into crops. This would account for the
bareness of the little shops, the bareness of the few
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
boards and trestles designed for market purposes in
a corner of the street, the bareness of the obsolete
inn and inn yard, with the ominous inscription,
&lsquo;Excise Office,&rsquo; not yet faded out from the gateway,
as indicating the very last thing that poverty could
get rid of....&rdquo; The village alehouse, mentioned
in the first chapter of &ldquo;Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s Ground,&rdquo;
and there called the Peal of Bells, is the White
Hart, Stevenage, where Dickens called on his way
to see Lucas to inquire of the landlord, old Sam
Cooper, the shortest route to the &ldquo;ruined hermitage
of Mr. Mopes the hermit,&rdquo; some five miles distant.
He found Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s Ground to be &ldquo;a nook in
a rustic by-road, which the genius of Mopes had
laid waste as completely as if he had been born an
Emperor and a Conqueror. Its centre object was
a dwelling-house, sufficiently substantial, all the
window-glass of which had been long ago abolished
by the surprising genius of Mopes, and all the
windows of which were barred across with rough-split
logs of trees nailed over them on the outside.
A rick-yard, hip high in vegetable rankness and ruin,
contained out-buildings, from which the thatch had
lightly fluttered away ... and from which the
planks and beams had heavily dropped and rotted.&rdquo;
After noting the fragments of mildewed ricks and
the slimy pond, the traveller encountered the hermit
himself, as well as he could be observed between the
window-bars, &ldquo;lying on a bank of soot and cinders,
on the floor, in front of a rusty fireplace,&rdquo; when
presently began the interview with &ldquo;the sooty
object in blanket and skewer,&rdquo; as related in the
narrative with approximate exactitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN DICKENS LAND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Kent, sir! Everybody knows Kent. Apples,
cherries, hops, and women.&rdquo; Thus did Alfred
Jingle briefly summarize for the behoof of Tracy
Tupman the principal characteristics of the county
which, by general consent, is termed &ldquo;the Garden of
England,&rdquo; a designation richly merited through its
sylvan charms and other natural beauties.</p>
<p>This division of south-eastern England is rightly
considered as the very heart of Dickens land, for the
reason that no other locality (excepting, of course,
the great Metropolis) possesses such numerous
associations with the novelist and his writings. He
himself practically admitted as much when, in 1840,
he said: &ldquo;I have many happy recollections connected
with Kent, and am scarcely less interested in it than
if I had been a Kentish man bred and born, and had
resided in the county all my life.&rdquo; It was in Kent,
too, where he made his last home and where he drew
his last breath.</p>
<p>As already narrated in the opening chapter of this
volume, some of Dickens&rsquo;s earliest years were spent
at Chatham, and the locality within the radius of a
few miles became familiar to him by means of pedestrian
excursions with his father; indeed, it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
during one of these delightful jaunts that he first
saw the house at Gad&rsquo;s Hill which subsequently
became his own property, and the incident is thus
faithfully recorded (although thinly disguised) in one
of &ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller&rdquo; papers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So smooth was the old highroad, and so fresh
were the horses, and so fast went I, that it was
midway between Gravesend and Rochester, and the
widening river was bearing the ships, white-sailed or
black-smoked, out to sea, when I noticed by the
wayside a very queer small boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Halloa!&rsquo; said I to the very queer small boy.
&lsquo;Where do you live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At Chatham,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you do there?&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I go to school,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took him up in a moment, and we went on.
Presently the very queer small boy says: &lsquo;This is
Gad&rsquo;s Hill we are coming to, where Falstaff went
out to rob those travellers, and ran away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know something about Falstaff, eh?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All about him,&rsquo; said the very queer small boy.
&lsquo;I am old (I am nine), and I read all sorts of books.
But <i>do</i> let us stop at the top of the hill, and look at
the house there, if you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You admire that house?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bless you, sir!&rsquo; said the very queer small boy,
&lsquo;when I was not more than half as old as nine it
used to be a treat for me to be brought to look at it.
And ever since I can recollect my father, seeing me
so fond of it, has often said to me: &ldquo;If you were to
be very persevering, and were to work hard, you
might some day come to live in it,&rdquo; though that&rsquo;s
impossible,&rsquo; said the very queer small boy, drawing a
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
low breath, and now staring at the house out of the
window with all his might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was rather amazed to be told this by the very
queer small boy, for that house happens to be <i>my</i>
house, and I have reason to believe that what he said
was true.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a></p>
<p>In another &ldquo;Uncommercial&rdquo; paper Dickens recorded
his impressions of a later visit to this neighbourhood:
&ldquo;I will call my boyhood&rsquo;s home ...
Dullborough,&rdquo; he says, and further observes that he
found himself rambling about the scenes among
which his earliest days were passed&mdash;&ldquo;scenes from
which I departed when a child, and which I did not
revisit until I was a man,&rdquo; when he found the place
strangely altered, for the railway had since disfigured
the land. The railway-station &ldquo;had swallowed up
the playing-field, the two beautiful hawthorn-trees,
the hedge, the turf, and all those buttercups and
daisies had given place to the stoniest of roads;
while, beyond the station, an ugly dark monster of
a tunnel kept its jaws open, as if it had swallowed
them and were ravenous for more destruction.&rdquo; He
confesses that he was not made happy by the disappearance
of the old familiar landmarks of his boyhood,
but adds reflectively: &ldquo;Who was I that I
should quarrel with the town for being so changed
to me, when I myself had come back, so changed, to
it? All my early readings and early imaginations
dated from this place, and I took them away so full
of innocent construction and guileless belief, and I
brought them back so worn and torn, so much the
wiser and so much the worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same paper reference is made to the Dullborough
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
(<i>i.e.</i>, Chatham) Mechanics&rsquo; Institute&mdash;&ldquo;There
had been no such thing in the town in my young
days&rdquo;&mdash;which he found with some difficulty, for the
reason that &ldquo;it led a modest and retired existence up
a stable-yard.&rdquo; He learned, however, that it was &ldquo;a
most flourishing institution, and of the highest benefit
to the town, two triumphs which I was glad to understand
were not at all impaired by the seeming drawbacks
that no mechanics belonged to it, and that it
was steeped in debt to the chimney-pots. It had a
large room, which was approached by an infirm stepladder,
the builder having declined to construct the
intended staircase without a present payment in cash,
which Dullborough (though profoundly appreciative
of the Institution) seemed unaccountably bashful
about subscribing.&rdquo; In aid of the funds Dickens
soon afterwards gave some public Readings in this
very building, with the result that its financial
position was considerably improved.</p>
<p>Dickens&rsquo;s affection for Kent is indicated by the
fact that he selected that county in which to spend
his honeymoon, and in the village of Chalk (near
Gravesend, on the main road to Dover) may still be
seen the cottage where that happy period was spent,
and in which he wrote some of the earlier pages of
&ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a> It is a corner house on the southern
side of the road, advantageously situated for commanding
views of the river Thames and the far-stretching
landscape beyond. In after-years, whenever
his walks led him to this spot, he invariably
slackened his pace on arriving at the house, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
meditatively glanced at it for a few moments,
mentally reviving the time when he and his bride
found a pleasant home within its hospitable walls.
Shortly after the birth of their eldest son, Dickens
and his wife stayed at the honeymoon cottage, which,
with its red-tiled roof and dormer windows, is a
picturesque object on this famous coaching road.
The walk to Chalk Church was much favoured by
the novelist, where a quaint carved figure over the
entrance porch interested him. This curious piece
of sculpture, which he always greeted with a friendly
nod, is supposed to represent an old priest grasping
by the neck a large urn-like vessel, concerning
which there is probably a legend. Another grotesque
is seen above, and between the two is a niche, in
which formerly stood an image of the virgin saint
(St. Mary) to whom this thirteenth-century church
is dedicated. About a mile distant, and a little south
of the main road, is Shorne, another typical Kentish
village, which, with its church and burial-ground,
constituted for Dickens another source of attraction,
and the latter was probably in his mind when he referred
(in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;) to &ldquo;one of the most peaceful
and secluded churchyards in Kent, where wild-flowers
mingle with the grass, and the soft landscape around
forms the fairest spot in the garden of England.&rdquo;
Shorne formerly boasted a celebrity, one Sir John
Shorne, who achieved fame by the curing of ague
and gained notoriety as the custodian of the devil,
whom, it is alleged, he imprisoned in a boot, with
the result that shrines were erected to his memory.<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a></p>
<p>Of the towns in Southern England associated with
Dickens, perhaps none is more replete with memories
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
of the novelist than Broadstairs. It was but a little
Kentish watering-place when, in the autumn of 1837,
he and his wife first passed a seaside holiday there, at
No. 12 (now No. 31), High Street, a humble-looking
tenement of two storeys in height, with a small
parlour facing the narrow thoroughfare; the house
survived until a few years ago, although in an altered
form, and has since been rebuilt. In 1890 it was
tenanted by a plumber and glazier, who apparently
did not know of its literary associations, for here
were written some of the later pages of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;
Formerly of some importance, Broadstairs at this
time had just emerged from the condition of a village
into which it had lapsed, and in 1842 began to attain
some celebrity as a place of fashionable resort for
sea-bathing. Dickens delighted in the quietude of
the spot, and Broadstairs became his favourite summer
or autumn resort for many years. In 1839 we find
him located at No. 40, Albion Street (two doors
from the Albion Hotel), where he finished the
writing of &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; and composed the
dedication of that story to his cherished friend
Macready. During the following year he went twice
to Broadstairs, being then at work upon &ldquo;The Old
Curiosity Shop,&rdquo; and in all probability found a lodgment
in the Albion Street house; for, writing to
Maclise the day after his arrival there, on June 1,
he urged him to &ldquo;come to the bower which is shaded
for you in the one-pair front, where no chair or table
has four legs of the same length, and where no
drawers will open till you have pulled the pegs off,
and then they keep open and won&rsquo;t shut again.&rdquo;
In 1845 and his family engaged rooms for the
month of August at the Albion Hotel, and again,
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
apparently, in 1847, judging from an allusion to his
&ldquo;looking out upon a dark gray sea, with a keen
north-east wind blowing it in shore.&rdquo; The Albion
was favoured by him in 1859,<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a> when, suffering in
health, he went for a week&rsquo;s sea air and change, to
prepare himself for the exacting labours of a provincial
Reading tour. Dickens delighted to entertain
his friends at the Albion, where, upon one of the
walls, hangs an original letter containing a description
of Broadstairs, penned by the novelist himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good sea&mdash;fresh breezes&mdash;fine sands&mdash;and
pleasant walks&mdash;with all manner of fishing-boats,
lighthouses, piers, bathing-machines, are its only
attractions; but it is one of the freshest and freest
little places in the world.&rdquo; Here, too, is jealously
preserved an ancient oak chest on which he was wont
to sit while he and his intimates quaffed the old
hostelry&rsquo;s unrivalled milk-punch.</p>
<p>An amusing description of his mode of life at
Broadstairs&mdash;of the mild distractions and innocent
pleasures to be enjoyed there&mdash;is discoverable in a
characteristic letter addressed by him to Professor
Felton from that watering-place in 1843: &ldquo;This is
a little fishing-place; intensely quiet; built on a
cliff, whereon, in the centre of a tiny semicircular
bay, our house stands, the sea rolling and dashing
under the windows. Seven miles out are the Goodwin
Sands (you&rsquo;ve heard of the Goodwin Sands?),
whence floating lights perpetually wink after dark,
as if they were carrying on intrigues with the servants.
Also there is a big lighthouse called the North
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
Foreland on a hill behind the village&mdash;a severe,
parsonic light, which reproves the young and giddy
floaters, and stares grimly out upon the sea. Under
the cliff are rare good sands, where all the children
assemble every morning and throw up impossible
fortifications, which the sea throws down again at
high-water. Old gentlemen and ancient ladies flirt
after their own manner in two reading-rooms and
on a great many scattered seats in the open air.
Other old gentlemen look all day through telescopes
and never see anything. In a bay-window in a one-pair
sits, from nine o&rsquo;clock to one, a gentleman with
rather long hair and no neckcloth, who writes and
grins as if he thought he were very funny indeed.
His name is Boz. At one he disappears, and
presently emerges from a bathing-machine, and may
be seen&mdash;a kind of salmon-coloured porpoise&mdash;splashing
about in the ocean. After that he may be
seen in another bay-window on the ground-floor
eating a strong lunch; after that walking a dozen
miles or so, or lying on his back in the sand reading
a book. Nobody bothers him unless they know he
is disposed to be talked to, and I am told he is very
comfortable indeed. He&rsquo;s as brown as a berry, and
they <i>do</i> say is a small fortune to the innkeeper, who
sells beer and cold punch. But this is mere rumour.
Sometimes he goes up to London (eighty miles or so
away), and then, I&rsquo;m told, there is a sound in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields (Forster&rsquo;s residence) at night as
of men laughing, together with a clinking of knives
and forks and wineglasses.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> Again, in 1850: &ldquo;You
will find it the healthiest and freshest of places, and
there are Canterbury, and all varieties of what Leigh
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
Hunt calls &lsquo;greenery,&rsquo; within a few minutes&rsquo; railroad
ride. It is not very picturesque ashore, but extremely
so seaward, all manner of ships continually passing
close inshore.&rdquo; Writing to the Earl of Carlisle
in 1851, he jocularly said: &ldquo;The general character
of Broadstairs as to size and accommodation was
happily expressed by Miss Eden, when she wrote to
the Duke of Devonshire (as he told me), saying how
grateful she felt to a certain sailor, who asked leave
to see her garden, for not plucking it bodily up and
sticking it in his buttonhole. You will have for
a night-light,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;in the room we shall give
you, the North Foreland lighthouse. That and the
sea and air are our only lions. It is a rough little
place, but a very pleasant one, and you will make it
pleasanter than ever to me.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a> To Forster at this
time he remarked of his Broadstairs environment:
&ldquo;It is more delightful here than I can express. Corn
growing, larks singing, garden full of flowers, fresh
air on the sea&mdash;oh, it is wonderful!&rdquo; One of
his minor writings is wholly devoted to a description
of &ldquo;Our Watering-Place&rdquo; (for so the paper is
entitled), in which there are many happy touches
recalling Broadstairs of more than fifty years ago.
Here is the beach as seen at low tide: &ldquo;The ocean
lies winking in the sunlight like a drowsy lion;
its glassy waters scarcely curve upon the shore;
the fishing-boats in the tiny harbour are all stranded
in the mud. Our two colliers ... have not an
inch of water within a quarter of a mile of them,
and turn exhausted on their sides, like faint fish of an
antediluvian species. Rusty cables and chains, ropes
and rings, undermost parts of posts and piles,
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
and confused timber defences against the waves, lie
strewn about in a brown litter of tangled seaweed
and fallen cliff.... The time when this pretty
little semicircular sweep of houses, tapering off at the
end of the wooden pier into a point in the sea, was a
gay place, and when the lighthouse overlooking
it shone at daybreak on company dispersing from
public balls, is but dimly traditional now.&rdquo; The
following depicts, with the skill of a master hand,
the same scene at high-water: &ldquo;The tide has risen;
the boats are dancing on the bubbling water; the
colliers are afloat again; the white-bordered waves
rush in.... The radiant sails are gliding past the
shore and shining on the far horizon; all the sea is
sparkling, heaving, swelling up with life and beauty
this bright morning.&rdquo; To the parish church the
author refers disrespectfully as &ldquo;a hideous temple of
flint, like a great petrified haystack,&rdquo; and of the pier,
built in 1809, he says: &ldquo;We have a pier&mdash;a queer
old wooden pier, fortunately&mdash;without the slightest
pretensions to architecture, and very picturesque in
consequence. Boats are hauled up upon it, ropes are
coiled all over it; lobster-pots, nets, masts, oars, spars,
sails, ballast, and rickety capstans, make a perfect
labyrinth of it.&rdquo; In the same paper he observes:
&ldquo;You would hardly guess which is the main street
of our watering-place,<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a> but you may know it by
its being always stopped up with donkey-chaises.
Whenever you come here, and see harnessed donkeys
eating clover out of barrows drawn completely across
a narrow thoroughfare, you may be quite sure you
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
are in our High Street.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> The reference here
to donkeys prompts the statement that at Broadstairs
lived the original of Betsy Trotwood in &ldquo;David
Copperfield.&rdquo; She was a Miss Strong, who occupied
a double-fronted cottage in the middle of Nuckell&rsquo;s
Place, on the sea-front, and who, like the admirable
Betsy, was firmly convinced of her right to stop the
passage of donkeys along the road opposite her door,
deterring their proprietors by means of hostile
demonstrations with a hearth-broom. Close by
there is a cottage which has been christened Dickens
House, and in Broadstairs there is a Dickens
Road.</p>
<p>Tired of the discomforts of seaside lodgings,
Dickens began to search for a house at Broadstairs
which he could hire for the period of his annual
visits. He discovered in Fort House a residence
that seemed to fulfil his requirements; but it was not
yet available, and he was fain to content himself for
a while with Lawn House, a smaller villa, the garden
of which adjoins the western boundary of the grounds
of Fort House. Abutting upon the south side of
Lawn House, whence a good view of the German
Ocean is obtainable, is the archway referred to in one
of the published letters,<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a> spanning the narrow road
approached from Harbour Street and leading to the
coastguard station, this road passing the front of
Fort House between it and the sea-wall. Not until
the autumn of 1850 did he succeed in obtaining
possession of Fort House, situated on the Kingsgate
Road, perched upon the summit of a bold headland
of the Thanet cliffs, with a superb panorama of sea
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
and country. At that time there was a cornfield
between the house and the harbour. Alas! a cornfield
no longer, but land upon which some cottages
and stables have since been built, these partly
obstructing the view southward.</p>
<p>Fort House, to which were attached pleasure
grounds of about an acre in extent, was approached
by a carriage drive, and the rental value in 1883
was &pound;100 a year. This &ldquo;airy nest&rdquo; (as he described
his Broadstairs home) formed a conspicuous landmark
in the locality, and proved a constant source
of attraction to visitors by reason of its associations.
Edmund Yates thus describes it as seen by him at a
subsequent period: &ldquo;It is a small house without any
large rooms, but such a place as a man of moderate
means, with an immoderate family of small children,
might choose for a summer retreat. The sands
immediately below afford a splendid playground;
there is an abundant supply of never-failing ozone;
there is a good lawn, surrounded by borders well-stocked
with delicious-smelling common English
flowers, and there is, or was in those days, I imagine,
ample opportunity for necessary seclusion. The
room in which Dickens worked is on the first floor,
a small, three-cornered slip, &lsquo;about the size of a
warm bath,&rsquo; as he would have said, but with a large
expansive window commanding a magnificent sea-view.
His love for the place, and his gratitude for
the good it always did him, are recorded in a hundred
letters.&rdquo; In 1889 the late Mr. W. R. Hughes and
the present writer were privileged to examine Fort
House, and our impressions have been duly recorded.
We approached the study by a little staircase leading
from the first floor, and from the veranda-shaded
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
window witnessed a lovely view of the sea. Perhaps
it was nothing more than coincidence, but Dickens
seemed to prefer, as places of residence, houses having
semicircular frontages, and Fort House proved no
exception, his study being in the bowed front facing
the ocean. Here he wrote the concluding lines of
what the author himself regarded as the best of all
his books, &ldquo;David Copperfield.&rdquo; Let it be distinctly
averred that not a line of &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo;
was penned in this abode (as is generally supposed),
and that it is quite an erroneous idea to associate
Fort House with the home of Mr. Jarndyce, so
minutely described in that story. This being the
case, it is unfortunate that a later owner of the
property committed the indiscretion of changing the
name of the building to Bleak House, by which
misleading designation it has been known for a considerable
period.</p>
<p>After a good many years of disuse, Bleak House
fell into a lamentable state of decay, and it is much
to be deplored that the local authorities did not avail
themselves of the opportunity afforded them of
acquiring (for the sake of preservation) the residence
which so frequently became the favourite seaside
dwelling of the genius of the place. They, however,
did not rise to the occasion, with the result that, in
consequence of remaining so long uninhabited, the
house suffered seriously from dilapidation, and the
garden (containing the old swing where the novelist
used to swing his children) became a wilderness of
weeds. Recently the property was sold, and the
owner thought fit to restore, alter, and extend the
premises, converting the building into a pretentious-looking
mansion of Tudor design, with castellated
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
eaves and other &ldquo;improvements,&rdquo; by which it is
changed beyond all recognition.</p>
<p>In 1847 Broadstairs commenced to grow out of
favour with the novelist, for it then began to attract
large numbers of holiday folks, with an attendant
train of outdoor entertainers, who deprived him of
that quietude and seclusion so indispensable for his
work. &ldquo;Vagrant music is getting to that height
here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and is so impossible to be escaped
from, that I fear Broadstairs and I must part company
in time to come. Unless it pours of rain, I cannot
write half an hour without the most excruciating
organs, fiddles, bells, or glee-singers. There is a
violin of the most torturing kind under the window
now (time, ten in the morning), and an Italian box
of music on the steps, both in full blast.&rdquo; Dickens
did not desert the town just yet, however, as in 1851
(in order to escape the excitement in London caused
by the Great Exhibition) he decided to let the town
house (Devonshire Terrace) for a few months, and
engaged Fort House from the beginning of May
until November, his longest sojourn at Broadstairs.
This was not the last visit (as stated in a note in the
published &ldquo;Letters&rdquo;), as he spent a week there in
the summer of 1859 for sea air and change, thus to
assist recovery from a slight illness, and prepare for
the severe ordeal of a provincial Reading tour. After
1859 Broadstairs knew him no more, although we
are assured that he ever retained an affectionate
interest in that &ldquo;pretty little watering-place.&rdquo; Mr.
Hughes has recorded an interview with an &ldquo;old
salt,&rdquo; one Harry Ford, who well remembered the
novelist when, in early days, he (Dickens) went with
his family to stay at Broadstairs. &ldquo;Bless your soul!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
he said, &ldquo;I can see &lsquo;Old Charley&rsquo; (as we used to
call him among ourselves here) a-coming flying down
from the cliff with a hop, step, and jump, with his
hair all flying about. He used to sit sometimes on
that rail&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the one surrounding the
harbour&mdash;&ldquo;with his legs lolling about, and sometimes
on the seat that you&rsquo;re a-sitting on now&rdquo; (adjoining
the old look-out house opposite the Tartar Frigate
Inn), &ldquo;and he was very fond of talking to us fellows
and hearing our tales; he was very good-natured,
and nobody was liked better. And if you&rsquo;ll read
that story that he wrote and printed about &lsquo;Our
Watering-Place,&rsquo; <i>I</i> was the man who&rsquo;s mentioned
there as mending a little ship for a boy. <i>I</i> held that
child between my knees. And, what&rsquo;s more, <i>I</i> took
&lsquo;Old Charley,&rsquo; on the very last time that he came
over to Broadstairs (he wasn&rsquo;t living here at the time),
round the Foreland to Margate, with a party of four
friends. I took &rsquo;em in my boat, the <i>Irene</i>&rdquo;&mdash;pointing
to a clinker-built, strong boat lying in the harbour,
capable of holding twenty people. &ldquo;The wind was
easterly, the weather was rather rough, and it took
me three or four hours to get round. There was a
good deal of chaffing going on, I can tell you.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a></p>
<p>Of the neighbouring watering-place, Margate, but
little can be said from the Dickensian point of view,
for the novelist visited it so seldom, probably not
more than twice&mdash;viz., in 1844 and 1847, writing
thence on both occasions to Forster with particular
reference to the theatre there, which he honoured
with his patronage. In this respect Dover comes
within the same category, for he said, in 1852: &ldquo;It
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
is not quite a place to my taste, being too bandy (I
mean musical; no reference to its legs), and infinitely
too genteel. But the sea is very fine, and the walks
are quite remarkable. There are two ways of going
to Folkestone, both lovely and striking in the highest
degree, and there are heights and downs and country
roads, and I don&rsquo;t know what, everywhere.&rdquo;
Mention is frequently made of Dover in his books&mdash;of
its castle, pier, cliffs, harbour, theatre, etc.; the latter,
built in 1790, he described in 1856 as &ldquo;a miserable
spectacle&mdash;the pit is boarded over, and it is a drinking
and smoking place.&rdquo; Here is a pen-picture of the
fortified town from &ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities,&rdquo; as
it appeared more than a century ago: &ldquo;The little
narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from
the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a
marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of
sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did
what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It
thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs,
and brought the coast down, madly. The air among
the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that
one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in
the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a
quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward,
particularly at those times when the tide made,
and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did
no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably
realized large fortunes, and it was remarkable that
nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamp-lighter.&rdquo;
In &ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller,&rdquo; too,
we find this pleasing fancy in alluding to Dover:
&ldquo;There the sea was tumbling in, with deep sounds,
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
after dark, and the revolving French light on
Cape Grisnez was seen regularly bursting out and
becoming obscured, as if the head of a gigantic lightkeeper,
in an anxious state of mind, were interposed
every half-minute, to look how it was
burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dover, as everyone remembers, was the destination
of poor little ragged David Copperfield, who, tramping
wearily from London, went thither in quest of
his aunt, Betsy Trotwood. In 1852 Dickens stayed
for three months at No. 10, Camden Crescent,
and in 1861 he took apartments at the Lord Warden
Hotel.</p>
<p>The autumn of 1855 was spent by Dickens and his
family at No. 3, Albion Villas, Folkestone, &ldquo;a very
pleasant little house overlooking the sea,&rdquo; whither he
went, on the eve of the publication of &ldquo;Little Dorrit,&rdquo;
to &ldquo;help his sluggish fancy.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Reprinted Pieces&rdquo;
we find Folkestone disguised as &ldquo;Pavilionstone,&rdquo; thus
named after the Pavilion Hotel, originally a modest-looking
building erected on the sea-front in 1843, but
recently transformed into a huge establishment in order
to meet the requirements of modern-day travellers
<i>en route</i> to and from Boulogne. Even at the time
this article was written,<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a> the hotel is described as
containing &ldquo;streets of rooms&rdquo; and handsome salons.
Folkestone of to-day differs considerably from Folkestone
of fifty years ago, having developed during
the interval into a fashionable watering-place of
an almost resplendent character. Nevertheless, in
Dickens&rsquo;s presentment it is not impossible, even now,
to detect the tone and colouring of old Folkestone,
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
with its &ldquo;crooked street like a crippled ladder,&rdquo; etc.
&ldquo;Within a quarter of a century&mdash;<i>circa</i> 1830,&rdquo;
Dickens remarks, &ldquo;it was a little fishing town, and they
do say that the time was when it was a little smuggling
town.... The old little fishing and smuggling
town remains.... There are break-neck flights of
ragged steps, connecting the principal streets by back-ways,
which will cripple the visitor in half an hour....
In connection with these break-neck steps I observe
some wooden cottages, with tumbledown outhouses,
and backyards 3 feet square, adorned with garlands
of dried fish.... Our situation is delightful, our
air delicious, and our breezy hills and downs, carpeted
with wild thyme, and decorated with millions of wild
flowers, are, in the faith of the pedestrian, perfect.&rdquo;
He informs us that the harbour is a tidal one&mdash;&ldquo;At
low water we are a heap of mud, with an empty
channel in it&rdquo;&mdash;and delineates, with the sense of
a keen observer, the effects of high and low tide upon
the shipping, while the following is a typical example
of Dickensian humour: &ldquo;The very little wooden
lighthouse shrinks in the idle glare of the sun.
And here I may observe of the very little wooden
lighthouse, that when it is lighted at night&mdash;red
and green&mdash;it looks so like a medical man&rsquo;s,
that several distracted husbands have at various
times been found, on occasions of premature domestic
anxiety, going round it, trying to find the night-bell!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a></p>
<p>Strange to relate, Maidstone, the county town, is
mentioned only twice in Dickens&rsquo;s writings&mdash;namely,
in &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Seven Poor
Travellers&rdquo;; but there is a hint of his intention to
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
give more prominence to it in &ldquo;Edwin Drood&rdquo; by
making the county gaol the scene of Jasper&rsquo;s imprisonment.
It is conjectured that Maidstone is the
Muggleton of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; there described as &ldquo;a
corporate town, with a mayor, burgesses, and freemen,&rdquo;
with &ldquo;an open square for the market-place, and
in the centre a large inn,&rdquo; etc. That he knew the
locality well, even at this date, there can be no
doubt&mdash;indeed, it has been suggested that those
remarkable Druidical stones near by, known as Kit&rsquo;s
Coty House, with names, initials, and dates scratched
thereon, may have originated the idea of Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s immortal discovery of the stone inscribed
by &ldquo;Bill Stumps.&rdquo; Another Pickwickian link with
the neighbourhood is Cob-tree Hall, an Elizabethan
house near Aylesford, justly regarded as the original
of the Manor House at Dingley Dell, which, with its
surroundings, answers admirably to the description in
the fourth chapter of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We know that in later years he was fond of walking
between Maidstone and Rochester, the seven
miles constituting, in his opinion, &ldquo;one of the most
beautiful walks in England&rdquo;; and not infrequently,
when living at Gad&rsquo;s Hill, he would drive there with
friends for a picnic, the horses bestridden by &ldquo;a
couple of postillions in the old red jackets of the old
red royal Dover road.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was like a holiday ride
in England fifty years ago,&rdquo; he said to Longfellow,
commenting upon one of these delightful excursions.
Pilgrims in Dickens land would do well to visit Kit&rsquo;s
Coty House and Blue Bell Hill, where, from the
higher elevations, a prospect is revealed of enchanting
beauty; from such a point of vantage we behold an
extensive view of the valley, in which are seen little
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
hamlets, cornfields, hop gardens, orchards, and
spinneys, with the river Medway meandering in the
direction of Rochester, and gradually widening as it
approaches that ancient town.</p>
<p>The picturesque and charming city of Canterbury,
as portrayed in &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; has changed in
a much less degree than many other English cathedral
towns within the last twenty years or so. In that
delightful story, so replete with the autobiographical
element, we read: &ldquo;The sunny street of Canterbury,
dozing, as it were, in the hot light; ... its old
houses and gateways, and the stately gray cathedral,
with the rooks sailing round the towers&rdquo; (chap. xiii.).
&ldquo;Coming into Canterbury, I loitered through the old
streets with a sober pleasure that calmed my spirits
and eased my heart.... The venerable cathedral
towers and the old jackdaws and rooks, whose airy
voices made them more retired than perfect silence
would have done; the battered gateways, once stuck
full with statues, long thrown down, and crumbled
away, like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed
upon them; the still nooks, where the ivied growth
of centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls;
the ancient houses; the pastoral landscape of field,
orchard, and garden&mdash;everywhere, on everything, I
felt the same serener air, the same calm, thoughtful,
softening spirit&rdquo; (chap. xxxix.). In 1861, when
giving a public Reading at Canterbury, Dickens
stayed at the Fountain Hotel, in St. Margaret&rsquo;s
Street, which is recognised locally as &ldquo;the County
Inn&rdquo; where Mr. Dick slept when visiting David
Copperfield. The &ldquo;little inn&rdquo; where Mr. Micawber
put up is probably the Sun Hotel in Sun Street;
Dr. Strong&rsquo;s school is the still-flourishing King&rsquo;s
School in the cathedral precincts, its Norman staircase
being an object of great antiquarian interest.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GAD&rsquo;S HILL COUNTRY.</span></h2>
<p>About midway between Gravesend and Rochester,
on the old Dover Road, and in the parish of
Higham, is Gad&rsquo;s Hill, immortalized both by
Shakespeare and Dickens. With regard to the
derivation of the name there seems to be a little
doubt, some regarding it as a corruption of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
Hill,&rdquo; while others incline to the belief that it must be
traced to the word &ldquo;gad&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, rogue), for, even prior
to Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, unwary travellers were here
waylaid by highwaymen, and for such audacious thefts
from the person this particular spot became notorious.</p>
<p>In 1558 a ballad was published entitled &ldquo;The
Robbery at Gad&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; and in 1590 Sir Roger
Manwood, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, wrote:
&ldquo;Many robberies were done in the bye-ways at
Gadeshill, on the west part of Rochester and at
Chatham, down on the east part of Rochester, by
horse-thieves, with such fat and lusty horses as were
not like hackney horses, nor far-journeying horses,
and one of them sometimes wearing a vizard grey
beard ... and no man durst travel that way without
great company.&rdquo; In the first part of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;King Henry the Fourth&rdquo; (Act I., Scene 2)
Poins thus addresses Prince Henry: &ldquo;But, my lads,
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o&rsquo;clock, early
at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going to Canterbury
with rich offerings, and traders riding to London
with fat purses: I have visors for you all; you
have horses for yourselves.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a></p>
<p>To present-day pedestrians, who have no need to
fear unwelcome attentions from &ldquo;knights of the road,&rdquo;
the chief attraction of this locality is the house which
stands upon the brow of the hill, reposing in delightful
grounds, and commanding magnificent views of the
surrounding landscape. This is Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place,
the home of Charles Dickens, where he resided from
1856 until his death on &ldquo;that fateful day&rdquo; in June,
1870. One of the most remarkable incidents of the
novelist&rsquo;s life was the realization of his boyhood&rsquo;s
ambition to live there, in the very house which he
so often admired when, during his early years at
Chatham, he accompanied his father on walking
expeditions thence to Strood and beyond, and which,
as his parent foretold, might really become his home
if he worked hard, and were to be very persevering.
The desire to own the property never left him;
indeed, it may be said that, as time passed, his
craving to possess it increased, and we may imagine
his delight when, in 1855, he learned from his trusty
henchman, W. H. Wills, that the place was available
for purchase.</p>
<p>Having spent the final years of his active career
at Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place, it is natural that Gad&rsquo;s Hill
Place and its environment should be regarded as the
very heart of Dickens land, so replete is it with
Dickensian memories and associations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place is a red brick building, with bay
windows and a porch in the principal front, a slated
roof with dormers, surmounted by a cupola or bell-turret,
the latter a conspicuous and familiar object to
all accustomed to travel by road between Gravesend
and Rochester. The house was erected in 1779 by
a then well-known character in those parts, one
Thomas Stevens, an illiterate man who had been an
hostler, and who, after marrying his employer&rsquo;s widow,
adopted the brewing business, amassed wealth, and
eventually became Mayor of Rochester. On relinquishing
the business he retired to his country seat
at Gad&rsquo;s Hill, and at his death the house was
purchased by the Rev. James Lynn (father of the
late Mrs. Lynn Linton, the authoress), who, like
Dickens, had fallen in love with the house when a
youth, and resolved to buy it as soon as the opportunity
offered. It was not until 1831 that he was
enabled to take up his residence there, and Mrs.
Lynn Linton, in recording her impressions of her
home at that date, recalled the liveliness of the road:
&ldquo;Between seventy and eighty coaches, &lsquo;vans,&rsquo; and
mail-carts passed our house during the day, besides
private carriages, specially those of travellers posting
to or from Dover. Regiments, too, often passed on
their way to Gravesend, where they embarked for
India; and ships&rsquo; companies, paid off, rowdy, and
half-tipsy, made the road really dangerous for the
time being. We used to lock the two gates when
we heard them coming, shouting and singing, up the
hill, and we had to stand many a mimic siege from
the bluejackets trying to force their way in.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a> To counteract these obvious drawbacks there were natural
advantages&mdash;the luxuriant gardens, orchard, and
shrubberies, while the trees near the house offered
a veritable sanctuary for song-birds. The worthy
clergyman occupied Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place until his decease
in 1855, when, for want of an heir, the property had
to be sold. Shortly afterwards his daughter and
W. H. Wills met at a dinner-party, and in the
course of conversation it transpired that the estate
would presently be in the market. On learning this,
Dickens immediately entered into negotiations for
acquiring it, with the result that before many months
had elapsed he became the owner. &ldquo;I have always
in passing looked to see if it was to be sold or let,&rdquo;
he wrote to his friend M. de Cerjat, &ldquo;and it has
never been to me like any other house, and it has
never changed at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">RESTORATION HOUSE, ROCHESTER. (<i><a href="#Page_217">Page 217</a>.</i>)
<br />The &ldquo;Satis House&rdquo; of &ldquo;Great Expectations.&rdquo; Charles II. slept here on the eve of the Restoration, May, 1660.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>After drawing a cheque (on March 14, 1856) for
the amount of the purchase-money, &pound;1,790, he discovered
that, by an extraordinary coincidence, it was
a Friday, the day of the week on which (as he frequently
remarked) all the important events of his life
had happened, so that he and his family had come to
regard that day of the week as his lucky day.</p>
<p>Dickens did not, however, obtain possession of the
coveted house until February of the following year,
after which, for a brief period, he made it merely a
summer abode, Tavistock House being his town
residence during the rest of the year. In April,
1857, he stayed with his wife and sister-in-law at
Waite&rsquo;s Hotel, Gravesend, to be at hand to superintend
the beginning of a scheme of alterations and
improvements in his new home, which were carried
on for the space of several months. The winter of
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
1859-1860 was the last spent at Tavistock House,
and he and his family then settled down at Gad&rsquo;s Hill.
&ldquo;I am on my little Kentish freehold,&rdquo; he observed
to M. de Cerjat, &ldquo;looking on as pretty a view out
of my study window as you will find in a long day&rsquo;s
English ride. My little place is a grave red-brick
house, which I have added to and stuck bits upon in
all manner of ways, so that it is as pleasantly irregular,
and as violently opposed to all architectural ideas, as
the most hopeful man could possibly desire. The
robbery was committed before the door, on the man
with the treasure, and Falstaff ran away from the
identical spot of ground now covered by the room
in which I write. A little rustic alehouse, called the
Sir John Falstaff, is over the way, has been over the
way ever since, in honour of the event. Cobham
Woods and Park are behind the house, the distant
Thames in front, the Medway, with Rochester and
its old castle and cathedral, on one side. The whole
stupendous property is on the old Dover Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continued ownership brought increased liking,
and he was never tired of devising and superintending
improvements, such as the addition of a new
drawing-room and conservatory, the construction of
a well (a process &ldquo;like putting Oxford Street endwise&rdquo;),
and the engineering of a tunnel under the
road, connecting the front-garden with the shrubbery,
with its noble cedars, where, in the midst of foliage,
was erected the Swiss ch&acirc;let presented to him in 1865
by Fechter, the actor, and which now stands in
Cobham Park. Concerning this ch&acirc;let&mdash;in an upper
compartment of which he was fond of working,
remote from disturbing sounds&mdash;he sent a charming
account of his environment to his American friend
James T. Fields: &ldquo;Divers birds sing here all day,
and the nightingales all night. The place is lovely
and in perfect order.... I have put five mirrors in
the chalet where I write, and they reflect and refract,
in all kinds of ways, the leaves that are quivering at
the windows, and the great fields of waving corn,
and the sail-dotted river. My room is up among the
branches of the trees, and the birds and the butterflies
fly in and out, and the green branches shoot in at the
open windows, and the lights and shadows of the
clouds come and go with the rest of the company.
The scent of the flowers, and, indeed, of everything
that is growing for miles and miles, is most delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Externally, the main building of Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place
underwent but little alteration, presenting throughout
the period of the owner&rsquo;s occupation much the same
appearance as when he knew it in the days of his
childhood, the back of the building becoming
gradually hidden from view by clustering masses of
ivy and Virginia creeper. One of the bedrooms was
transformed into a study, which he lined with books
and occasionally wrote in; but the study proper (called
by him the library) was the front room on the
ground-floor, on the right of the entrance-hall,
rendered familiar by the large engraving published
in the <i>Graphic</i> at the time of the novelist&rsquo;s death.
With regard to this study, or library, it may be
mentioned that it was his delight to be surrounded
by a variety of objects for his eye to rest upon in the
intervals of actual writing, prominent among them
being a bronze group representing a couple of frogs
in the act of fighting a duel with swords, and a
statuette of a French dog-fancier, with his living
stock-in-trade tucked under his arms and in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
pockets, while a vase of flowers invariably graced his
writing-table. A noteworthy feature of his sanctum
was the door, the inner side of which he disguised
by means of imitation book-backs, transferred thither
from Tavistock House; these are still preserved as
a &ldquo;fixture.&rdquo; These book-backs, with their humorous
titles, create considerable interest and amusement for
such as are privileged to enter the apartment so intimately
associated with &ldquo;Boz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among those invited to his attractive &ldquo;Kentish
freehold,&rdquo; as Dickens frequently termed it, &ldquo;where
cigars and lemons grew on all the trees,&rdquo; was
Sir Joseph Paxton, the famous landscape gardener
and designer of the Crystal Palace. Hans Andersen,
another honoured guest, received most agreeable
impressions of Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place. He described the
breakfast-room as &ldquo;a model of comfort and holiday
brightness. The windows were overhung, outside,
with a profusion of blooming roses, and one looked
out over the garden to green fields and the hills
beyond Rochester.&rdquo; Dickens&rsquo;s happiest hours in his
Gad&rsquo;s Hill home were those when it was filled with
cherished friends, both English and American, to
whom he played the part of an ideal host, devoting
the greater portion of each day to their comfort and
amusement, and accompanying them on pedestrian
excursions to Rochester and other favourite localities
in the neighbourhood, or driving with them to more
remote places, such as Maidstone and Canterbury.
But what seemed to afford him the utmost delight
were the walks with friends to the charming village
of Cobham, there to refresh at the famous Leather
Bottle, the quaint roadside alehouse where, as every
reader of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; remembers, the disconsolate
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
Mr. Tupman was discovered at the parlour table having
just enjoyed a hearty meal of &ldquo;roast fowl, bacon,
ale, and etceteras, and looking as unlike a man who
had taken his leave of the world as possible.&rdquo; The
Pickwickian traditions of this popular house of refreshment
are maintained by the enthusiastic landlord, who
realizes the importance of preserving the Dickensian
associations. The room in which Mr. Tupman
drowned his sorrows in the comfort afforded by
a substantial meal remains practically the same to-day,
with this difference, that the walls are covered
with portraits, engravings, autograph letters, and
other interesting items relating to the novelist and his
writings&mdash;a veritable Dickens museum. Cobham
Hall, the Elizabethan mansion of Lord Darnley,
with its magnificent park, where the Fechter ch&acirc;let
was re-erected after Dickens&rsquo;s death, and especially
Cobham Woods, always proved irresistible attractions
to the &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; and he and his dogs enjoying their
constitutional were a familiar sight to his neighbours.</p>
<p>The villages of Shorne and Chalk, with their
ancient churches and peaceful churchyards, he
frequently visited with &ldquo;a strange recurring fondness.&rdquo;
Mr. E. Laman Blanchard has recorded that
he often met, and exchanged salutations with, Dickens
during his pedestrian excursions on the highroad
leading from Rochester to Gravesend, and generally
they passed each other at about the same spot&mdash;at
the outskirts of the village of Chalk, where a
picturesque lane branched off towards Shorne and
Cobham. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says Mr. Blanchard, &ldquo;the
brisk walk of Charles Dickens was always slackened,
and he never failed to glance meditatively for a few
moments at the windows of a corner house on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
southern side of the road, advantageously situated for
commanding views of the river and the far-stretching
landscape beyond. It was in that house he
lived immediately after his marriage, and there
many of the earlier chapters of &lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo; were
written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The village of Cooling, standing so bleak and
solitary in the Kentish fenland bordering the
southern banks of the Thames, possessed a weird
fascination for &ldquo;Boz.&rdquo; Here, in the midst of those
dreary marshes, much of the local colouring of
&ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo; was obtained. Indeed, the
story opens with the night scene between Pip and the
escaped convict in Cooling churchyard, and in the
same chapter we have Pip&rsquo;s early impressions of the
strange and desolate neighbourhood in which he
lived with Mr. and Mrs. Joe Gargery. &ldquo;Ours was
the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the
river wound, twenty miles from the sea. My first
most vivid and broad impression of the identity of
things seems to me to have been gained on a
memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such
a time I found out for certain that this bleak place
overgrown with nettles was the churchyard, and that
Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgina,
wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that
Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and
Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also
dead and buried; and that the dark, flat wilderness
beyond the churchyard, intersected with dykes, and
mounds, and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it,
was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond
was the river; and that the distant savage lair, from
which the wind was rushing, was the sea; and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all,
and beginning to cry, was Pip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marshes,&rdquo; Pip continues, &ldquo;were just a long
black horizontal line then, ... and the river was
just another horizontal line, not nearly so broad
nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long
angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed.
On the edge of the river I could faintly make
out the only two black things in all the prospect that
seemed to be standing upright. One of these was
the beacon by which the sailors steered&mdash;like an
unhooped cask upon a pole&mdash;an ugly thing when you
were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains
hanging to it which had once held a pirate.&rdquo; Then,
in a later chapter, he refers to the old battery out on
the marshes. &ldquo;It was pleasant and quiet out there,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;with the sails on the river passing beyond
the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was
low, looking as if they belonged to sunken ships
that were still sailing on at the bottom of the
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visitors to Cooling cannot fail to notice in the
churchyard a long row of curious gravestones which
mark the resting-place of members of the Comport
family of Cowling Court (Cooling was originally
called Cowling), these memorials dating from 1771,
the year recorded on a large headstone standing
in close proximity. These suggested to Dickens, of
course, the idea of the &ldquo;five little stone lozenges&rdquo;
under which the five little brothers of Pip lay buried.
Within a short distance from the churchyard we may
identify, in a short row of cottages, the original
of Joe&rsquo;s forge, while an old-fashioned inn with a
weather-board exterior, and bearing the sign of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
Horseshoe and Castle, is regarded as the prototype
of the Three Jolly Bargemen, a favourite resort of
Joe Gargery after his day&rsquo;s work at the forge.</p>
<p>The ancient and picturesque city of Rochester, so
beloved by Dickens and so replete with memories of
the &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; deserves a chapter to itself. With
the exception of London, no town figures so frequently
or so prominently in his books as Rochester, from
&ldquo;The Pickwick Papers&rdquo; to the unfinished romance
of &ldquo;The Mystery of Edwin Drood,&rdquo; where it is
thinly disguised as &ldquo;Cloisterham.&rdquo; Dickens&rsquo;s acquaintance
with Rochester began in the days of his boyhood,
when he lived with his father at Chatham,
and, as a natural result of his unusual powers of
observation, he even then stored up his youthful
impressions of the quaint old houses, the Cathedral,
and its neighbour, the rugged ruins of the Norman
Castle overlooking the Medway. How those juvenile
impressions received something of a shock in after-years
we are informed by Forster, for childhood
exaggerates what it sees, and Rochester High Street
he remembered as a thoroughfare at least as wide as
Regent Street, whereas it proved to his maturer
judgment to be &ldquo;little better than a lane,&rdquo; while the
public clock in it, once supposed by him to be the
finest clock in the world, proved eventually to be
&ldquo;as moon-faced and weak a clock as a man&rsquo;s eyes
ever saw.&rdquo; Even the grave-looking Town Hall,
&ldquo;which had appeared to him once so glorious
a structure&rdquo; that he associated it in his mind
with Aladdin&rsquo;s palace, he reluctantly realized as
being, in reality, nothing more than &ldquo;a mere
mean little heap of bricks, like a chapel gone
demented.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah! who was I,&rdquo; he observes on
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
reflection, &ldquo;that I should quarrel with the town for
being changed to me, when I myself had come back,
so changed, to it? All my early readings and early
imaginations dated from this place, and I took them
away so full of innocent construction and guileless
belief, and I brought them back so worn and torn, so
much the wiser and so much the worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochester has undergone many topographical
changes (not necessarily for the better) since that
memorable morning in 1827 when Mr. Pickwick
leaned over the balustrades of the old stone bridge
&ldquo;contemplating nature and waiting for breakfast.&rdquo;
To begin with, the bridge itself has been demolished,
and an elliptical iron structure takes its place. The
view, too, which Mr. Pickwick admired of the banks
of the Medway, with the cornfields, pastures, and
windmills, is more obscured to-day by that discomforting
symbol of commercialism, smoke, so
constantly pouring from the ever-increasing number
of lofty shafts appertaining to the various cement
works which flourish here. From the other side of
the bridge Mr. Pickwick could obtain a pleasant
glimpse of the river, with its numerous sailing-barges,
in the direction of Chatham; but the
prospect, alas! is now completely blotted out by
hideous railway viaducts. Happily, in spite of
modern innovations, those who appreciate the old-world
air of our English cities will find much to
charm them in the precincts of the Cathedral,
sufficiently remote from the bustle and noise of the
High Street to enable it to preserve the quiet
serenity which invariably encompasses our venerable
minsters. Besides the picturesque stone gateways
here, much remains in the High Street and elsewhere
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
to remind us of what Rochester looked like
in days of old; as Dickens writes in &ldquo;The Seven
Poor Travellers&rdquo;: &ldquo;The silent High Street of
Rochester is full of gables, with old beams and
timbers carved into strange faces.&rdquo; Of these
surviving specimens of ancient domestic architecture,
many will regard Eastgate House as the
most interesting from an arch&aelig;ological point of
view, while to the Dickens student there is an
additional attraction in the fact that it is the original
of the Nuns&rsquo; House in &ldquo;Edwin Drood,&rdquo; the boarding-school
for young ladies over which Miss Twinkleton
presided, and where Rosa Bud received her education.</p>
<p>For many years during the last century Eastgate
House was actually in use as a ladies&rsquo; school,
and eventually became the headquarters of the
Rochester Men&rsquo;s Institute. Quite recently the
civic authorities, with commendable good sense,
availed themselves of the opportunity of acquiring
the property, which they have thoroughly and
tastefully reinstated and converted into a public
museum; and I must add to this statement the
significant fact that a room has been permanently
set apart for an exhibition of mementoes of Charles
Dickens&mdash;both gifts and loans&mdash;thus, in a sense,
stultifying the old proverb, that &ldquo;a prophet is not
without honour save in his own country.&rdquo; On one
of the inside beams of Eastgate House is carved the
date &ldquo;1591,&rdquo; and the rooms are adorned with
carved mantelpieces and plaster enrichments.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Nearly opposite Eastgate House is another
picturesque half-timbered building, which, with its
three gables and its projecting bay-windows
supported by carved brackets, is a veritable
ornament to this portion of the High Street.
We recognise it as the one-time residence of two
of Dickens&rsquo;s characters, viz., of Mr. Sapsea, the
auctioneer in &ldquo;Edwin Drood&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Sapsea&rsquo;s
premises are in the High Street over against the
Nuns&rsquo; House&rdquo;&mdash;and of Mr. Pumblechook, the
seed merchant in &ldquo;Great Expectations.&rdquo; But there
exists in Rochester a specimen of domestic architecture
of even greater interest than those just described.
This is Restoration House, pleasantly situated facing
an open space called &ldquo;The Vines&rdquo;&mdash;the Monks&rsquo;
Vineyard of &ldquo;Edwin Drood.&rdquo; Restoration House
is the Satis House of &ldquo;Great Expectations,&rdquo; where
lived that strange creature Miss Havisham; as a
matter of fact, there exists in Rochester an actual
Satis House, the name being transferred by Dickens
to the old manor-house associated with Pip and
Estella, and with that &ldquo;immensely rich and grim
lady&rdquo; the aforesaid Miss Havisham. Restoration
House, which dates from Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, afforded
temporary lodging to Charles II. in 1660, who
subsequently honoured his host, Sir Francis Clarke,
with a series of large tapestries of English workmanship,
which are still preserved.</p>
<p>In Rochester High Street the visitor cannot fail
to observe, on the north side, a stone-fronted
building with three gables, having over the entrance-gate
a curiously inscribed tablet, which reads thus:</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Richard Watts, Esquire</span>,
<br />by his Will dated 22nd August, 1579,
<br />founded this Charity
<br />for Six Poor Travellers,
<br />who, not being Rogues or Proctors,
<br />May receive gratis for one Night
<br />Lodging, Entertainment,
<br />and Fourpence each.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>This quaint institution, founded by Master
Richard Watts, Rochester&rsquo;s sixteenth-century philanthropist,
still flourishes, and it is an exceptional
thing for a night to pass without its full complement
of applicants for temporary board and lodging,
according to the terms formulated by the charitable
founder, by whom also were established several
almshouses situated on the Maidstone Road, endowed
for the support and maintenance of impoverished
Rochester townsfolk. Watts&rsquo;s Charity, in the High
Street, is immortalized by Dickens in the Christmas
number of <i>Household Words</i>, 1854, entitled &ldquo;The
Seven Poor Travellers,&rdquo; in which the story of
Richard Doubledick is one of the most touching
things the novelist ever penned. Dickens, doubtless,
frequently visited the Charity during his Gad&rsquo;s Hill
days, for he delighted in escorting his American friends
and others around the old city, and pointing out to
them its more striking features. In one of the
visitors&rsquo; books, in which many distinguished names are
recorded, will be found (under date May 11,
1854, the year of publication of the above-mentioned
Christmas number) the bold autographs of Charles
Dickens and his friend Mark Lemon.</p>
<p>An account of Dickensian Rochester which
omitted to mention the Bull Inn would be
unpardonably incomplete. The Bull, the historic
Bull of &ldquo;The Pickwick Papers,&rdquo; which the
imperturbable Mr. Jingle averred to Mr. Pickwick
was a &ldquo;good house&rdquo; with &ldquo;nice beds,&rdquo; is naturally
one of the principal sights of Rochester from the
point of view of the Dickens admirer and student,
and Dickens pilgrims from all parts of the world
immediately direct their steps thither on their arrival
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
in the city. Situated on the south side of the High
Street, within a short distance of Rochester Bridge,
the Bull and Victoria Hotel (to give its full
designation) has an exceedingly unprepossessing
brick frontage, its only decorative feature being the
Royal Arms over the entrance. Why does the
famous coaching-inn bear the double sign of the
Bull and <i>Victoria</i>? It originated in this way:
One stormy day at the end of November, 1836,
the late Queen Victoria (then Princess), with her
mother the Duchess of Kent, stopped at the Bull;
they were travelling to London from Dover, and
the royal party, warned of the possibility of their
carriage being upset in crossing the bridge, stayed
at the hostelry all night, the apartment in which
England&rsquo;s future Sovereign slept being the identical
room previously allocated to Mr. Tupman in
&ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo; Naturally, in order to commemorate
the royal visit, the inn was called by its present
designation, although popularly known simply as the
Bull. Some portions of the establishment still
retain their old-world characteristics, although it
must be confessed that the appearance of the
majority of the dormitories and living-rooms partakes
more of the early Victorian period than of an
earlier date; one might conjecture, too, that the
house had been refronted during the beginning of
the nineteenth century. The place is replete with
Pickwickian associations; here we may see the
veritable staircase where the stormy interview occurred
between the irate Dr. Slammer and Alfred Jingle;
here, too, is the actual ball-room, which, with its
glass chandeliers and &ldquo;elevated den&rdquo; for the
musicians, has remained unaltered since the description
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
of it appeared in &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo; The sleeping
apartments of Messrs. Tupman and Winkle
(&ldquo;Winkle&rsquo;s bedroom is inside mine,&rdquo; said Mr.
Tupman) may be identified in those numbered 13
and 19 respectively, while Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room is
distinguished as &ldquo;No. 17,&rdquo; which tradition declares
was occupied on at least one occasion by Dickens
himself, and now contains some pieces of furniture
formerly in use at Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place. Although
much less prominently than in &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; the
Bull is introduced in other works of Dickens.
It appears, for example, in one of the &ldquo;Sketches by
Boz,&rdquo; entitled &ldquo;The great Winglebury Duel&rdquo;
(written before &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;), where &ldquo;the little
town of Great Winglebury&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Winglebury
Arms&rdquo; are undoubtedly intended for Rochester
and its principal hostelry. In &ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo;
the Bull is again introduced as the Blue Boar,
where it will be remembered that, in honour of the
important event of Pip being bound apprentice to
Joe Gargery (the premium having been paid by
Miss Havisham), arrangements were made for a
dinner at the Blue Boar, attended by the servile
Pumblechook, the Hubbles, and Mr. Wopsle.
&ldquo;Among the festivities indulged in rather late in
the evening,&rdquo; observes Pip, who did not particularly
enjoy himself on the occasion, &ldquo;Mr. Wopsle gave
us Collins&rsquo;s Ode, and &lsquo;threw his blood-stain&rsquo;d sword
in thunder down,&rsquo; with such effect that a waiter
came in and said, &lsquo;The commercials underneath sent
up their compliments, and it wasn&rsquo;t the Tumblers&rsquo;
Arms!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was recently rumoured that the Bull, not
proving satisfactorily remunerative, stood in danger
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
of demolition, and that a new hotel, possessing those
improvements which present-day travellers regard as
indispensable, would be erected on the site. Needless
to say, all Dickens lovers would deplore the
realization of such a proposal.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>I venture to conclude with a few supplementary
remarks concerning Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place, the bourne to
which all devout Dickens worshippers make a
pilgrimage, among whom our American cousins are
undoubtedly the most ardent enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Dickens paid the purchase-money for Gad&rsquo;s Hill
Place on March 14, 1856; it was a Friday, and
handing the cheque for &pound;1,790 to Wills, he observed:
&ldquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t it an extraordinary thing&mdash;look at the
day&mdash;Friday! I have been nearly drawing it half a
dozen times, when the lawyers have not been ready,
and here it comes round upon a Friday as a matter
of course.&rdquo; He frequently remarked that all the
important events of his life happened to him on a
Friday. Referring to this transaction, Mrs. Lynn
Linton, in &ldquo;My Literary Life,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;We sold it
cheap, &pound;1,700, and we asked &pound;40 for the ornamental
timber. To this Dickens and his agent made an
objection; so we had an arbitrator, who awarded us
&pound;70, which was in the nature of a triumph.&rdquo; The
house contains fourteen rooms and the usual offices;
there are greenhouses, stables, a kitchen-garden, a
farmyard, etc., the property comprising eleven acres
of land, a considerable portion of which Dickens
subsequently acquired through private negotiations
with the respective owners.</p>
<p>At Gad&rsquo;s Hill Dickens produced some of his
best work. During the period of his residence here
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
(1857-1870), he wrote the concluding chapters of
&ldquo;Little Dorrit,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities,&rdquo; &ldquo;Great
Expectations,&rdquo; &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend,&rdquo; and the fragment
of &ldquo;The Mystery of Edwin Drood,&rdquo; concerning
which Longfellow entertained a very high opinion,
believing that it promised to be one of the finest of his
stories; he also contributed to <i>All The Year Round</i>
those remarkable papers published under the general
title of &ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller,&rdquo; perhaps the
most delightful of his minor writings.</p>
<p>It was on June 8, 1870, that Dickens, while at
dinner, suddenly became very ill and almost immediately
lost consciousness, from which he never
recovered. On the following day his spirit fled, and
it is no exaggeration to say that never has the death
of a distinguished man caused greater consternation
throughout the civilized world than did the unexpected
passing of the great novelist.</p>
<p>Not many weeks had elapsed after this sad event
when Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place and its contents were disposed
of by public auction. The house, with eight acres of
meadow-land, was virtually bought in by Charles
Dickens the younger at the much enhanced price of
&pound;7,500. For a time the novelist&rsquo;s eldest son made it
his home; but, as he informed the present writer,
the increasing needs of his large and growing young
family could not be sufficiently accommodated, and
this determined him to sell the place&mdash;a decision
which naturally caused those interested in its fate to
fear the possibility of its falling into the hands of an
unsympathetic proprietor, who would fail to appreciate
or to cherish the unique associations. After being a
considerable time on the market, the property was purchased
in 1879 by Captain (now Major) Austin F.
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
Budden, then of the 12th Kent Artillery Volunteers,
and Mayor of Rochester from that year until 1881.</p>
<p>It was during Major Budden&rsquo;s occupancy of Gad&rsquo;s
Hill Place, in the late summer of 1888, that I
accompanied my friend the late Mr. W. R. Hughes
(author of &ldquo;A Week&rsquo;s Tramp in Dickens Land&rdquo;)
on a memorable visit to this famous residence. We
met with a most friendly reception from the genial
host and his wife, and were privileged to inspect
every point of interest within and without&mdash;the
library with its curious dummy book-backs, the
dining-room where &ldquo;the Master&rdquo; succumbed to the
fatal seizure, the conservatory (his &ldquo;last improvement&rdquo;),
the well (with the Major&rsquo;s mare, Tell-tale,
busily drawing water), the grave of the pet canary,
the tunnel under the Dover road, etc. Perhaps the
most unexpected treat was the view from the roof of
the building, whence it is easy to realize the charming
environment. Looking northward from this high
elevation, we may view the marshes, which flat and
dreary expanse is relieved by a glimpse of the
Thames, widening as it approaches seaward, and
bearing upon its silvery bosom a number of vessels,
both steamships and sailing ships, the ruddy brown
sails of the barges giving colour to the scene. To
the east is the valley of the Medway, the prospect including
a distant view of Rochester, crowned by the
rugged keep of the old Castle and by the Cathedral
tower.<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a> To the south the beautifully undulating
greensward of Cobham Park and the umbrageous
Cobham Woods complete this wonderful panorama
of Nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>In 1889 (the year following that of our visit)
Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place narrowly escaped destruction by
fire. It is the old story&mdash;a leakage of gas, a naked
light, and an explosion; happily, Major Budden&rsquo;s
supply of hand-grenades did their duty and saved
the building. Shortly afterwards the house and
accompanying land were again in the market, and
in 1890 a purchaser was found in the Hon. Francis
Law Latham, Advocate-General at Bombay. This
gentleman, however, could not enter into possession
until his return to England a few months later.
Meanwhile Major Budden took up his residence
elsewhere, so that during a part of the year 1891
Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place was empty and deserted, pathetically
contrasting with those ever-to-be-remembered
days when Charles Dickens and his hosts of friends
enlivened the neighbourhood with cricket matches,
athletic sports, etc. Mr. Latham is still the tenant-owner
of Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place, and, needless to say,
thoroughly appreciates the unique associations of
his attractive home, where he hopes to spend in
quiet and secluded retirement the remaining years
of a busy life.</p>

Queries</i>) I am indebted for much useful information respecting
the early London homes of Charles Dickens. He has discovered
that in the parish rate-book for October 8, 1823, the name of
John Dickens appears as the tenant of No. 16, Bayham Street,
and also at No. 18; in the next rate-book (January 21, 1824)
No. 16 is marked &ldquo;empty.&rdquo; In 1866 the Metropolitan Board
of Works renumbered Bayham Street (then consisting of about
a hundred and fifty houses), incorporating therewith Bayham
Street South and Fleming Place.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_19" href="#fr_19">[19]</a>The Fox-under-the-Hill stood at the foot of Ivy Bridge Lane,
which formed a boundary between Westminster City and the
Liberty of the Duchy of Lancaster (Savoy). Between Salisbury
Stairs (adjoining the little tavern) and London Bridge there
plied three halfpenny steamboats, named respectively the <i>Ant</i>,
the <i>Bee</i>, and the <i>Cricket</i>, whereof the latter two came to an
untimely end. The building of the Hotel Cecil has wiped out
Cecil and Salisbury Streets, and entirely transformed this locality,
including the destruction of the quaint ale-house itself.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a>Possibly a mistake of the rate-collector. The name Roylance
is not uncommon in the district.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a>In 1820 Seymour Street, with the site of Euston Square

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_22" href="#fr_22">[22]</a>A writer in Hone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Year-Book,&rdquo; 1826, says: &ldquo;Somers
Town is full of artists, as a reference to the Royal Academy
Catalogue will evince. In Clarendon Square still lives, I believe,
Scriven, the engraver, an artist of great ability and, in his day,
of much consideration. In the same neighbourhood dwells the
venerable Dr. Wilde, who may be justly termed the best engraver
of his age for upwards of half a century.&rdquo;</div>
<p class="fncont">W. H. Wills (assistant editor on <i>All the Year Round</i>), in
recalling Somers Town of this period, refers to its &ldquo;aristocracy,&rdquo;
and to the Polygon as its &ldquo;Court centre,&rdquo; situated in the middle
of Clarendon Square. &ldquo;In and around it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Art and
Literature nestled in cosy coteries, with half-pay officers (including
one Peninsular Colonel), city merchants, and stockbrokers....
The most eminent historical engravers of that
day dated their works, &lsquo;as the Act directs,&rsquo; from Somers
Town.&rdquo; Theodore Hook lived in Clarendon Square, and
Peter Pindar, Sir Francis Burdett, with other notabilities, in
close proximity thereto.</p>
<div class="fncont">The houses which comprised the Polygon prior to 1890 were
demolished by the Midland Railway Company in the following
year, and the buildings now occupying the site were erected by
the Company for habitation by persons of the labouring class
who were displaced by the acquisition of the property.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_23" href="#fr_23">[23]</a>Another popular novelist, William Black, also lived in this

suite of rooms in Wood&rsquo;s Hotel (Furnival&rsquo;s Inn) on the first-floor,
south-east corner of the main building.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_27" href="#fr_27">[27]</a>The date of Edmund Yates&rsquo;s residence here was 1854 <i>et seq.</i>
The rent of his house (he says) was &pound;70 a year, &ldquo;on a repairing
lease&rdquo; (which means an annual outlay of from &pound;25 to &pound;30 to
keep the bricks and mortar and timbers together), and the
accommodation consisted of a narrow dining-room, a little back
bedroom, two big drawing-rooms, two good bedrooms, three
attics, with kitchen and cellar in the basement. This description

Dickens&rsquo;s home, five doors distant.

sufficient authority for the tradition, for the present designation
is perhaps not older than the middle of the eighteenth century,
the original sign being most likely The Castle, without any
preceding genitive, Richardson, for example, thus referring to

residence in the parish of St. Marylebone, he took sittings for a
year or two in the Little Portland Street Unitarian Chapel, for

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_41" href="#fr_41">[41]</a>Tavistock House was for many years the residence of
James Perry (editor of Dickens&rsquo;s old paper, the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, in its best days), and was then noted for its reunions
of men of political and literary distinction. Eliza Cook, the
poetess, also lived in Tavistock House when she left Greenhithe,
Kent, and Mary Russell Mitford (authoress of &ldquo;Our Village&rdquo;)
became an honoured guest there in 1818. The house was afterwards
divided, and the moiety, which still retained the name of
Tavistock, became the home of Frank Stone.</div>
<div class="fncont">From the front windows of Tavistock House, which stood
immediately on the right on entering the railed-in garden or
square, the spire of St. Pancras Church was plainly visible,
being but a short distance away. The pillars of the gateway
leading to the enclosure were (and are) surmounted by quaint
lamps with iron supports. Dickens held the lease from the
Duke of Bedford at a &ldquo;peppercorn&rdquo; ground-rent.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_42" href="#fr_42">[42]</a>The portrait-bust was probably that executed in marble by
Dickens&rsquo;s beloved friend Angus Fletcher (&ldquo;Poor Kindheart,&rdquo; as
the novelist called him), whose mother was an English beauty
and heiress. He died in 1862. At the sale of Dickens&rsquo;s effects
in 1870, the bust realized fifty-one guineas, and it would be
interesting to know its present destination. The pair of reliefs
after Thorwaldsen were disposed of on the same occasion for
eight and a half guineas.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_44" href="#fr_44">[44]</a>I quote the opening lines of this eccentric effusion:</div>
<p class="fncont">&ldquo;&lsquo;Great men,&rsquo; no doubt, have a great deal to answer for.
No one will deny that. Their &lsquo;genius,&rsquo; which brings them to
the front, and which causes men, women, and children to worship
them for the pleasure their beautiful gifts procure to eyes, ears,
and senses, brings them all much responsibility.</p>
<p class="fncont">&ldquo;But who would ever have imagined that their dwellings
may bring grave responsibility and grave trouble to those who
take up their abode in a house which the presence of their
genius has hallowed? I live in Tavistock House, Tavistock
Square, London&mdash;a dear house, in a nice, quiet, shady garden,
where grow fine large old plantains (out of the Square proper),
and where in summer, from every window of the house, you
may imagine yourself in the country&mdash;the real country! That
sounds very grand and luxurious in London; and though the
mere fact of living in the house has very nearly brought upon
me the most terrible fate which can befall a human being
nowadays&mdash;namely, <i>that of a sane person shut up in a lunatic
asylum, put there for the purpose of being slowly or &lsquo;accidentally&rsquo;
murdered</i>&mdash;I cling to the spot because I have spent the happiest,
the most interesting, and the most illumined part of my life
there; also days of the most bitter anguish, the most heart-crushing
despair, when I was obliged to leave the dear home
and husband for some time, because I could not stop crying.
The thought of my loss and the shipwreck of my life was too
vivid, too much for me. I went away and returned when I had
got calm enough to restrain my tears, but with the sun set for
ever on what remained to me of the summer of middle life. I
love the dear home, too, because my darling puggies are buried
in the garden under the mulberry-tree, without a tombstone,
alas! because ever since they died I have been planning to have
a pretty monument made to mark the spot where they lay, and
that when I have thought I could afford myself that pleasure
somebody has generally stolen my money ... and I have to
put off ordering the intended <i>work of art</i>, which I mean it to
be, till I feel &lsquo;flush&rsquo; again. I was a slave to my dear Dan for
nearly thirteen years, and I think I must have loved that dog as
much as anybody ever loved anything in this world.</p>
<p class="fncont">&ldquo;I must not let you wonder too long what I am driving at,
my readers, by telling you that, through the mere fact of living
in what had been a house where a great man had lived, I nearly got
locked up in a lunatic asylum. You must think me insane,
I fancy, to say such a thing, and I must confess that you might
guess every mortal and immortal thing under the sun, but you
would never guess how this most frightful occurrence took
place.</p>
<p class="fncont">&ldquo;Those who have read Charles Dickens&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life,&rsquo; by Mr.
Forster, will know that he is the &lsquo;great man&rsquo; who had lived at
Tavistock House for twelve [ten] years. People from all parts
of the world have come to look at the house Charles Dickens
lived in, and see the interior of the house, a request which I
have frequently complied with.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fncont">On another page Mrs. Weldon says: &ldquo;Although three
keepers got into Tavistock House and actually laid hold of me,
I escaped their delicate intentions, as I consider, by a merciful
interposition of Providence....&rdquo;</p>

Stone could be easily swayed to and fro, its poise being so
accurate that a hand-push would set it in motion and cause it
to rock. In April, 1824, this huge rock was overthrown by a
party of sailors, and, filled with remorse for this foolish act, the
leader of the party (Lieutenant Goldsmith, nephew of the poet)
determined to replace it at his own expense, the stone being
swung back with pulleys to its original resting-place in November
of the same year, amid great local rejoicing. But its rocking
propensities were sadly diminished, and at the present time have
ceased altogether.

Cathedral is altogether out of harmony with the rest of this
Norman edifice. It was designed by Cottingham, and erected
in 1825 to replace the earlier tower, which was surmounted by
a thick stunted spire. A fund has been raised to which
the late Dean, Dr. Reynolds Hole, so generously contributed,
for the purpose of substituting a tower approximating in character
the older structure.</div>
<div class="fncont">At the time of publication (December, 1904) the lowering
and re-casing of the tower and the addition of a 66 ft. spire are
completed.

<h3><span class="small">THE</span>
<br />THACKERAY COUNTRY</h3>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By</span> LEWIS MELVILLE</p>
<p class="center">Large Crown 8vo. 3/6 cloth</p>
<p class="center">Containing 32 full-page Illustrations and a Map</p>
<p>&ldquo;THE THACKERAY COUNTRY&rdquo; treats of those localities
which are of primary interest to those who are acquainted
with the life and writings of the great novelist. Mr. Melville deals
with Thackeray&rsquo;s London homes and the salient features and
associations of their neighbourhood. He goes with Thackeray to
Paris, and follows the course of his travels on the Continent and
in America, giving special attention to those places that are made
the background of well-known scenes in the novels. He is careful
to give all the biographical information connected with Thackeray&rsquo;s
residences from his arrival in England from India at the age of six
until his death.</p>
<p>The volume is illustrated with thirty-two full-page plates
reproduced from photographs specially taken for the book by
Catharine W. Barnes Ward, and a map.</p>

<br />ROMANCE OF LONDON</h3>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By</span> GORDON HOME</p>

<p class="center">PUBLISHERS&rsquo; NOTE</p>
<p>The Romance of London, as the title is intended to
convey, is a book designed to bring before the reader
pictorially, and with interestingly written descriptive matter, the
survivals of the London of the Middle Ages, of Tudor times, and
of the picturesque seventeenth century.</p>
<p>That these relics are so numerous will surprise many people
who have not cared to explore London&rsquo;s antiquities. How many,
for instance, have seen all the Norman buildings in the City?
The Keep of the Tower, with its perfectly-preserved Chapel, is the
chief of the Norman structures; but besides this there is the grand
old Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, West Smithfield, the
crypt of St. Mary-le-Bow Church in Cheapside, and the newly-discovered
Norman portions of the crypt beneath the Guildhall.</p>
<p>The magnificent Norman nave of St. Paul&rsquo;s which survived the
Great Fire of 1666, was unfortunately demolished when the scheme
of restoration was abandoned.</p>
<p><b>The 12 illustrations in colour</b> include Westminster Abbey, The
Tower, St. Paul&rsquo;s, The Temple, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, Cloth Fair, and the
Pool of London, and amongst those in black and white are Charterhouse,
the old houses in Holborn, details of Westminster Abbey
and the Tower, and St. John&rsquo;s Gateway, Clerkenwell.</p>

<p>1. The inner suburbs, as to which there is often little to be told but the
best way of getting out of them.</p>
<p>2. The outer suburbs and quasi-independent towns a few miles off,
among which may still be pointed out field-paths and patches of rural
beauty. This zone, as within easy reach, we have described most fully.</p>
<h3>WHERE GREAT MEN LIVED IN LONDON</h3>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By</span> G. E. MITTON</p>
<p class="center">Crown 8vo., Cloth. Price 1/6 net</p>
<p>The power of appreciating associations might almost take rank as a
sixth sense, it is so keenly developed in some people and entirely
lacking in others. The fact that Cromwell lived in this house and that
Milton was born in the other, lifts the happy possessors of this sense into
another region straightway; the aroma of the past is as perceptible to them
as a fine scent or a beautiful scene. To such people the little handbook
now published will give great delight. It is divided into two parts, the
first containing the names of the great dead who once inhabited London
and peopled its streets, with information regarding their houses; and the
other giving a list of the streets in London wherein once lived any men
or women whose names have not died with them. It is of great interest
to see what distinguished inhabitants once occupied the streets wherein one
lives or where one&rsquo;s friends live. As a reference book this little volume will
be indispensable to many, but it is much more than a mere reference book.</p>

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
